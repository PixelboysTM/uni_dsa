chapter
i
toward
the
setting
sun
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
much
about
myself
first
of
all
because
there
is
not
very
much
to
tell
of
a
young
fellow
of
twentythree
and
then
because
i
hope
what
i
have
done
and
seen
will
be
more
interesting
than
i
am
for
between
you
and
me
i
often
find
jack
hildreth
a
dull
kind
of
person
especially
on
a
rainy
day
when
i
have
to
sit
in
the
house
alone
with
him
when
i
was
born
three
other
children
had
preceded
me
in
the
world
and
my
fathers
dreamy
blue
eyes
saw
no
way
of
providing
suitably
for
this
superfluous
fourth
youngster
and
then
my
uncle
john
came
forward
and
said
name
the
boy
after
me
and
ill
be
responsible
for
his
future
now
uncle
john
was
rich
and
unmarried
and
though
my
father
could
never
get
his
mind
down
to
anything
more
practical
than
deciphering
cuneiform
inscriptions
even
he
saw
that
this
changed
the
unflattering
prospects
of
his
latestborn
into
unusually
smiling
ones
so
i
became
jack
hildreth
secundus
and
my
uncle
nobly
fulfilled
his
part
of
the
contract
he
kept
me
under
his
own
eye
gave
me
a
horse
before
my
legs
were
long
enough
to
bestride
him
nevertheless
expecting
me
to
sit
him
fast
punished
me
well
if
i
was
quarrelsome
or
domineering
with
other
boys
yet
punished
me
no
less
surely
if
when
a
quarrel
was
forced
upon
me
i
showed
the
white
feather
or
failed
to
do
my
best
to
whip
my
enemy
fear
god
but
fear
no
man
never
lie
or
sneak
or
truckle
for
favor
never
betray
a
trust
never
be
cruel
to
man
or
beast
never
inflict
pain
deliberately
but
never
be
afraid
to
meet
it
if
you
must
be
kind
be
honest
be
daring
be
a
man
and
you
will
be
a
gentleman
this
was
my
uncles
simple
code
and
as
i
get
older
and
see
more
of
life
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
is
none
better
my
uncle
sent
me
to
the
jesuit
college
and
i
went
through
as
well
as
i
could
because
he
trusted
me
to
do
so
i
did
not
set
the
college
world
afire
but
i
stood
fairly
in
my
classes
and
was
first
in
athletics
and
my
old
soldier
uncle
cared
for
that
with
illconcealed
pride
when
i
left
the
students
life
and
began
to
look
about
on
real
life
and
wonder
where
to
take
hold
of
it
i
was
so
restless
and
overflowing
with
health
and
strength
that
i
could
not
settle
down
to
anything
and
the
fever
for
life
on
the
plains
came
upon
me
i
longed
to
be
off
to
the
wild
and
woolly
westthe
wilder
and
woollier
the
betterbefore
i
assumed
the
shackles
of
civilization
forever
go
if
you
choose
jack
my
uncle
said
men
are
a
better
study
than
books
after
youve
been
grounded
in
the
latter
begin
the
study
in
the
primer
of
an
aboriginal
race
if
you
like
indeed
it
may
be
best
theres
plenty
of
time
to
decide
on
your
future
for
as
youre
to
be
my
heir
theres
no
pressing
need
of
beginning
labor
my
uncle
had
the
necessary
influence
to
get
me
appointed
as
an
engineer
with
a
party
which
was
to
survey
for
a
railroad
among
the
mountains
of
new
mexico
and
arizonaa
position
i
was
competent
to
fill
as
i
had
chosen
civil
engineering
as
my
future
profession
and
had
studied
it
thoroughly
i
scarcely
realized
that
i
was
going
till
i
found
myself
in
st
louis
where
i
was
to
meet
the
scouts
of
the
party
who
would
take
me
with
them
to
join
the
surveyors
at
the
scene
of
our
labors
on
the
night
after
my
arrival
i
invited
the
senior
scout
sam
hawkins
to
sup
with
me
in
order
that
i
might
make
his
acquaintance
before
starting
in
the
morning
i
do
not
know
whether
the
wild
west
show
was
unconsciously
in
my
mind
but
when
mr
hawkins
appeared
at
the
appointed
time
i
certainly
felt
disappointed
to
see
him
clad
in
ordinary
clothes
and
not
in
the
picturesque
costume
of
buffalo
bill
till
i
reflected
that
in
st
louis
even
a
famous
indian
scout
might
condescend
to
look
like
everyday
mortals
so
youre
the
young
tenderfoot
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
sir
he
said
and
held
out
his
hand
smiling
at
me
from
an
extraordinary
face
covered
with
a
bushy
beard
of
many
moons
growth
and
shadowed
by
a
large
nose
a
trifle
awry
above
which
twinkled
a
pair
of
sharp
little
eyes
my
guest
surprised
me
not
a
little
after
i
had
responded
to
his
greeting
by
hanging
his
hat
on
the
gasfixture
and
following
it
with
his
hair
dont
be
shocked
he
said
calmly
seeing
i
suppose
that
this
was
unexpected
you
will
excuse
me
i
hope
for
the
pawnees
have
taken
my
natural
locks
it
was
a
mighty
queer
feeling
but
fortunately
i
was
able
to
stand
it
i
went
to
tacoma
and
bought
myself
a
new
scalp
and
it
cost
me
a
roll
of
good
dollars
it
doesnt
matter
the
new
hair
is
more
convenient
than
the
old
especially
on
a
warm
day
for
i
never
could
hang
my
own
wig
up
like
that
he
had
a
way
of
laughing
inwardly
and
his
shoulders
shook
as
he
spoke
though
he
made
no
sound
can
you
shoot
asked
my
queer
companion
suddenly
fairly
i
said
not
so
much
i
am
afraid
because
i
was
modest
as
because
i
wanted
to
have
the
fun
of
letting
him
find
out
that
i
was
a
crack
marksman
and
ride
if
i
have
to
if
you
have
to
not
as
well
as
you
shoot
then
pshaw
what
is
riding
the
mounting
is
all
that
is
hard
you
can
hang
on
somehow
if
once
youre
up
he
looked
at
me
to
see
whether
i
was
joking
or
in
earnest
but
i
looked
innocent
so
he
said
theres
where
you
make
a
mistake
what
you
should
have
said
is
that
mounting
is
hard
because
you
have
to
do
that
yourself
while
the
horse
attends
to
your
getting
off
again
the
horse
wont
see
to
it
in
my
case
i
said
with
confidenceborn
of
the
fact
that
my
kind
uncle
had
accustomed
me
to
clinging
to
highstrung
beasts
before
i
had
lost
my
milkteeth
a
kicking
broncho
is
something
to
try
the
mettle
of
a
tenderfoot
remarked
hawkins
dryly
i
suppose
you
know
what
a
tenderfoot
is
he
is
one
who
speaks
good
english
and
wears
gloves
as
if
he
were
used
to
them
he
also
has
a
prejudice
in
favor
of
nice
handkerchiefs
and
wellkept
fingernails
he
may
know
a
good
deal
about
history
but
he
is
liable
to
mistake
turkeytracks
for
bearprints
and
though
he
has
learned
astronomy
he
could
never
find
his
way
by
the
stars
the
tenderfoot
sticks
his
bowieknife
into
his
belt
in
such
a
manner
that
it
runs
into
his
thigh
when
he
bends
and
when
he
builds
a
fire
on
the
prairie
he
makes
it
so
big
that
it
flames
as
high
as
a
tree
yet
feels
surprised
that
the
indians
notice
it
but
many
a
tenderfoot
is
a
daring
strongbodied
and
stronghearted
fellow
and
though
there
was
no
doubt
that
i
was
a
tenderfoot
fast
enough
i
hoped
to
convince
sam
hawkins
that
i
had
some
qualities
requisite
for
success
on
the
plains
by
the
time
our
supper
was
over
there
was
a
very
good
understanding
established
between
me
and
the
queer
little
man
to
whose
faithful
love
i
was
to
owe
so
much
he
was
an
eccentric
fellow
with
a
pretence
of
crustiness
covering
his
big
true
heart
but
it
was
not
hard
to
read
him
by
the
law
of
contraries
and
our
mutual
liking
dated
from
that
night
of
meeting
we
set
out
in
the
early
dawn
of
the
following
morning
accompanied
by
the
other
two
scouts
dick
stone
and
will
parker
whom
i
then
saw
for
the
first
time
and
whom
i
learned
to
value
only
less
than
sam
as
the
truest
of
good
comrades
our
journey
was
as
direct
and
speedy
as
we
could
make
it
to
the
mountain
region
of
new
mexico
near
the
apache
indian
reservation
and
i
was
welcomed
by
my
fellowworkers
with
a
cordiality
that
gave
rise
to
hopes
of
pleasant
relations
with
them
which
were
never
realized
the
party
consisted
of
the
head
engineer
bancroft
and
three
men
under
him
with
them
were
twelve
men
intended
to
serve
as
our
protectors
a
sort
of
standing
army
and
for
whom
as
hardworking
pioneers
i
a
newcomer
had
considerable
respect
until
i
discovered
that
they
were
men
of
the
lowest
moral
standards
although
i
had
entered
the
service
only
for
experience
i
was
in
earnest
and
did
my
duty
conscientiously
but
i
soon
found
out
that
my
colleagues
were
genuine
adventurers
only
after
money
and
caring
nothing
for
their
work
except
as
a
means
of
getting
it
bancroft
was
the
most
dishonest
of
all
he
loved
his
bottle
too
well
and
got
private
supplies
for
it
from
santa
f
and
worked
harder
with
the
brandyflask
than
with
his
surveying
instruments
riggs
marcy
and
wheeler
the
three
surveyors
emulated
bancroft
in
this
unprofitable
pursuit
and
as
i
never
touched
a
drop
of
liquor
i
naturally
was
the
laborer
while
the
rest
alternated
between
drinking
and
sleeping
off
the
effects
it
goes
without
saying
that
under
such
circumstances
our
work
did
not
progress
rapidly
and
at
the
end
of
the
glorious
autumn
and
three
months
of
labor
we
found
ourselves
with
our
task
still
unaccomplished
while
the
section
with
which
ours
was
to
connect
was
almost
completed
besides
our
workmen
being
such
as
they
were
we
had
to
work
in
a
region
infested
with
comanches
kiowas
and
apaches
who
objected
to
a
road
through
their
territory
and
we
had
to
be
constantly
on
our
guard
which
made
our
progress
still
slower
personally
my
lot
was
not
a
bed
of
roses
for
the
men
disliked
me
and
called
me
tenderfoot
ten
times
a
day
and
took
a
special
delight
in
thwarting
my
will
especially
rattler
the
leader
of
our
socalled
guard
and
as
big
a
rascal
as
ever
went
unhanged
i
durst
not
speak
to
them
in
an
authoritative
manner
but
had
to
manage
them
as
a
wise
woman
manages
a
tyrannical
husband
without
his
perceiving
it
but
i
had
allies
in
sam
hawkins
and
his
two
companion
scouts
dick
stone
and
will
parker
they
were
friendly
to
me
and
held
off
from
the
others
in
whom
sam
hawkins
especially
managed
to
inspire
respect
in
spite
of
his
droll
peculiarities
there
was
an
alliance
formed
between
us
silently
which
i
can
best
describe
as
a
sort
of
feudal
relation
he
had
taken
me
under
his
protection
like
a
man
who
did
not
need
to
ask
if
he
were
understood
i
was
the
tenderfoot
and
he
the
experienced
frontiersman
whose
words
and
deeds
had
to
be
infallible
to
me
as
often
as
he
had
time
and
opportunity
he
gave
me
practical
and
theoretical
instruction
in
everything
necessary
to
know
and
do
in
the
wild
west
and
though
i
graduated
from
the
high
school
later
so
to
speak
with
winnetou
as
master
sam
hawkins
was
my
elementary
teacher
he
made
me
expert
with
a
lasso
and
let
me
practise
with
that
useful
weapon
on
his
own
little
person
and
his
horse
when
i
had
reached
the
point
of
catching
them
at
every
throw
he
was
delighted
and
cried
out
good
my
young
sir
thats
fine
but
dont
be
set
up
with
this
praise
a
teacher
must
encourage
his
stupid
scholars
when
they
make
a
little
progress
i
have
taught
lots
of
young
frontiersmen
and
they
all
learned
much
easier
and
understood
me
far
quicker
than
you
have
but
perhaps
its
possible
that
after
eight
years
or
so
you
may
not
be
called
a
tenderfoot
you
can
comfort
yourself
with
the
thought
that
sometimes
a
stupid
man
gets
on
as
well
as
or
even
a
little
better
than
a
clever
one
he
said
this
as
if
in
sober
earnest
and
i
received
it
in
the
same
way
knowing
well
how
differently
he
meant
it
we
met
at
a
distance
from
the
camp
where
we
could
not
be
observed
sam
hawkins
would
have
it
so
and
when
i
asked
why
he
said
for
mercys
sake
hide
yourself
sir
you
are
so
awkward
that
i
should
be
ashamed
to
have
these
fellows
see
you
so
thats
why
i
keep
you
in
the
shadethats
the
only
reason
take
it
to
heart
the
consequence
was
that
none
of
the
company
suspected
that
i
had
any
skill
in
weapons
or
special
muscular
strengthan
ignorance
that
i
was
glad
to
foster
one
day
i
gave
rattler
an
order
it
was
some
trifling
thing
too
small
for
me
to
remember
now
and
he
would
have
been
willing
to
carry
it
out
had
not
his
mood
been
rather
uglier
than
usual
do
it
yourself
he
growled
you
impudent
greenhorn
ill
show
you
im
as
good
as
you
are
any
day
youre
drunk
i
said
looking
him
over
and
turning
away
im
drunk
am
i
he
replied
glad
of
a
chance
to
get
at
me
whom
he
hated
very
drunk
or
id
knock
you
down
i
answered
rattler
was
a
big
brawny
fellow
and
he
stepped
up
in
front
of
me
rolling
up
his
sleeves
who
me
knock
me
down
well
i
guess
not
you
blower
you
kid
you
greenhorn
he
said
no
more
i
hit
him
square
in
the
face
and
he
dropped
like
an
ox
fearing
mischief
from
rattlers
followers
and
realizing
that
now
or
never
was
my
authority
to
be
established
i
drew
my
pistol
crying
if
one
of
you
puts
his
hand
to
a
weapon
ill
shoot
him
on
the
spot
no
one
stirred
take
your
friend
away
and
let
him
sober
up
and
when
he
comes
to
his
senses
he
may
be
more
respectful
i
remarked
as
the
men
obeyed
me
wheeler
the
surveyor
whom
i
thought
the
best
of
the
lot
stepped
from
the
others
and
came
up
to
me
that
was
a
great
blow
he
said
let
me
congratulate
you
i
never
saw
such
strength
theyll
call
you
shatterhand
out
here
this
seemed
to
suit
little
sam
exactly
he
threw
up
his
hat
shouting
joyously
shatterhand
good
a
tenderfoot
and
already
won
a
name
and
what
a
name
shatterhand
old
shatterhand
its
like
old
firehand
who
is
a
frontiersman
as
strong
as
a
bear
i
tell
you
boy
its
great
and
youre
christened
for
good
and
all
in
the
wild
west
and
so
i
found
myself
in
a
new
and
strange
life
and
beginning
it
with
a
new
name
which
became
as
familiar
and
as
dear
to
me
as
my
own
chapter
ii
my
first
buffalo
three
days
after
the
little
disciplining
i
had
given
rattler
mr
white
the
head
engineer
of
the
next
section
rode
over
to
us
to
report
that
their
work
was
finished
and
to
inquire
what
our
prospects
were
for
making
speedy
connection
when
he
set
out
on
his
return
he
invited
sam
hawkins
and
me
to
accompany
him
part
of
the
way
through
the
valley
we
found
him
a
very
agreeable
companion
and
when
we
came
to
the
point
where
we
were
to
turn
back
we
shook
hands
cordially
leaving
him
with
regret
theres
one
thing
i
want
to
warn
you
of
mr
white
said
in
parting
look
out
for
redskins
have
you
seen
them
sam
asked
not
them
but
their
tracks
now
is
the
time
when
the
wild
mustangs
and
the
buffaloes
go
southward
and
the
indians
follow
in
the
chase
the
kiowas
are
all
right
for
we
arranged
with
them
for
the
road
but
the
apaches
and
comanches
know
nothing
of
it
and
we
dont
dare
let
them
see
us
we
have
finished
our
part
and
are
ready
to
leave
this
region
hurry
up
with
yours
and
do
likewise
remember
theres
danger
and
goodby
sam
looked
gravely
after
his
retreating
form
and
pointed
to
a
footprint
near
the
spring
where
we
had
paused
for
parting
hes
quite
right
to
warn
us
of
indians
he
said
do
you
mean
this
footprint
was
made
by
an
indian
yes
an
indians
moccasin
how
does
that
make
you
feel
not
at
all
you
must
feel
or
think
something
what
should
i
think
except
that
an
indian
has
been
here
not
afraid
not
a
bit
oh
cried
sam
youre
living
up
to
your
name
of
shatterhand
but
i
tell
you
that
indians
are
not
so
easy
to
shatter
you
dont
know
them
but
i
hope
to
understand
them
they
must
be
like
other
men
enemies
to
their
enemies
friends
to
their
friends
and
as
i
mean
to
treat
them
well
i
dont
see
why
i
should
fear
them
youll
find
out
said
sam
or
youll
be
a
greenhorn
for
eternity
you
may
treat
the
indians
as
you
like
and
it
wont
turn
out
as
you
expect
for
the
results
dont
depend
on
your
will
youll
learn
by
experience
and
i
only
hope
the
experience
wont
cost
you
your
life
this
was
not
cheering
and
for
some
time
we
rode
through
the
pleasant
autumn
air
in
silence
suddenly
sam
reined
up
his
horse
and
looked
ahead
earnestly
through
halfclosed
lids
by
george
he
cried
excitedly
there
they
are
actually
there
they
are
the
very
first
ones
what
i
asked
i
saw
at
some
distance
ahead
of
us
perhaps
eighteen
or
twenty
dark
forms
moving
slowly
what
repeated
sam
bouncing
up
and
down
in
his
saddle
id
be
ashamed
to
ask
such
a
question
you
are
indeed
a
precious
greenhorn
cant
you
guess
my
learned
sir
what
those
things
are
before
your
eyes
there
i
should
take
them
for
deer
if
i
didnt
know
there
were
none
about
here
and
though
those
animals
look
so
small
from
here
i
should
say
they
were
larger
than
deer
deer
in
this
locality
thats
a
good
one
but
your
other
guess
is
not
so
bad
they
certainly
are
larger
than
deer
o
sam
they
surely
cant
be
buffaloes
they
surely
can
bisons
they
are
genuine
bisons
beginning
their
travels
and
the
first
i
have
seen
you
see
mr
white
was
right
buffaloes
and
indians
we
saw
only
a
footprint
of
the
red
men
but
the
buffaloes
are
there
before
our
eyes
in
all
their
strength
what
do
you
say
about
it
we
must
go
up
to
them
sure
and
study
them
study
them
really
study
them
he
asked
glancing
at
me
sidewise
in
surprise
yes
i
never
saw
a
buffalo
and
id
like
to
watch
them
i
felt
the
interest
of
a
naturalist
which
was
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
little
sam
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
saying
watch
them
only
watch
them
like
a
child
putting
his
eye
to
a
rabbits
hole
to
see
the
little
bunnies
o
you
young
tenderfoot
what
i
must
put
up
with
in
you
i
dont
want
to
watch
them
or
study
them
i
tell
you
hut
hunt
them
they
mean
meatmeat
do
you
understand
and
such
meat
a
buffalosteak
is
more
glorious
than
ambrosia
or
ambrosiana
or
whatever
you
call
the
stuff
the
old
greeks
fed
their
gods
with
i
must
have
a
buffalo
if
it
costs
me
my
life
the
wind
is
towards
us
thats
good
the
suns
on
the
left
towards
the
valley
but
its
shady
on
the
right
and
if
we
keep
in
the
shade
the
animals
wont
see
us
come
on
he
looked
to
see
if
his
gun
liddy
as
he
called
it
was
all
right
and
i
hastily
overhauled
my
own
weapon
seeing
this
sam
held
up
his
horse
and
asked
do
you
want
to
take
a
hand
in
this
of
course
well
you
let
that
thing
alone
if
you
dont
want
to
be
trampled
to
jelly
in
the
next
ten
minutes
a
buffalo
isnt
a
canary
bird
for
a
man
to
take
on
his
finger
and
let
it
sing
but
i
will
be
silent
and
obey
me
he
interrupted
in
a
tone
he
had
never
used
before
i
wont
have
your
life
on
my
conscience
and
you
would
ride
into
the
jaws
of
certain
death
you
can
do
what
you
please
at
other
times
but
now
ill
stand
no
opposition
had
there
not
been
such
a
good
understanding
between
us
i
would
have
given
him
a
forcible
answer
but
as
it
was
i
rode
after
him
in
the
shadow
of
the
hills
without
speaking
and
after
a
while
sam
said
in
his
usual
manner
there
are
twenty
head
as
i
reckon
once
a
thousand
or
more
browsed
over
the
plains
i
have
seen
early
herds
numbering
a
thousand
and
upward
they
were
the
indians
food
but
the
white
men
have
taken
it
from
them
the
redskin
hunted
to
live
and
only
killed
what
he
needed
but
the
white
man
has
ravaged
countless
herds
like
a
robber
who
for
very
lust
of
blood
keeps
on
slaying
when
he
is
well
supplied
it
wont
be
long
before
there
are
no
buffaloes
and
a
little
longer
and
therell
be
no
indians
god
help
them
and
its
just
the
same
with
the
herds
of
horses
there
used
to
be
herds
of
a
thousand
mustangs
and
even
more
now
a
man
is
lucky
if
he
sees
two
together
we
had
come
within
four
hundred
feet
of
the
buffaloes
unobserved
and
hawkins
reined
in
his
horse
in
the
van
of
the
herd
was
an
old
bull
whose
enormous
bulk
i
studied
with
wonder
he
was
certainly
six
feet
high
and
ten
long
i
did
not
then
know
how
to
estimate
the
weight
of
a
buffalo
but
i
should
now
say
that
he
must
have
weighed
sixteen
hundred
poundsan
astounding
mass
of
flesh
and
bone
thats
the
leader
whispered
sam
the
most
experienced
of
the
whole
crowd
whoever
tackles
him
had
better
make
his
will
first
i
will
take
the
young
cow
right
back
of
him
the
best
place
to
shoot
is
behind
the
shoulderblade
into
the
heart
indeed
its
the
only
sure
place
except
the
eyes
and
none
but
a
madman
would
go
up
to
a
buffalo
and
shoot
into
his
eyes
you
stay
here
and
hide
yourself
and
your
horse
in
the
thicket
when
they
see
me
theyll
run
past
here
but
dont
you
quit
your
place
unless
i
come
back
or
call
you
he
waited
until
i
had
hidden
between
two
bushes
and
then
rode
slowly
forward
it
seemed
to
me
this
took
great
courage
i
had
often
read
how
buffaloes
were
hunted
and
knew
all
about
it
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
printed
page
and
the
real
thing
today
i
had
seen
buffaloes
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
though
at
first
i
only
wished
to
study
them
as
i
watched
sam
i
felt
an
irresistible
longing
to
join
in
the
sport
he
was
going
to
shoot
a
young
cow
pshaw
that
i
thought
required
no
courage
a
true
man
would
choose
the
strongest
bull
my
horse
was
very
restless
he
too
had
never
seen
buffaloes
before
and
he
pawed
the
ground
frightened
and
so
anxious
to
run
that
i
could
scarcely
hold
him
would
it
not
be
better
to
let
him
go
and
attack
the
old
bull
myself
i
debated
this
question
inwardly
divided
between
desire
to
go
and
regard
for
sams
command
meantime
watching
his
every
movement
he
had
approached
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
buffaloes
when
he
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
into
the
herd
past
the
mighty
bull
up
to
the
cow
which
he
had
selected
she
pricked
up
her
ears
and
started
to
run
i
saw
sam
shoot
she
staggered
and
her
head
dropped
but
i
did
not
know
whether
or
not
she
fell
for
my
eyes
were
chained
to
another
spot
the
great
bull
which
had
been
lying
down
was
getting
up
and
turned
toward
sam
hawkins
what
a
mighty
beast
the
thick
head
with
the
enormous
skull
the
broad
forehead
with
its
short
strong
horns
the
neck
and
breast
covered
with
the
coarse
mane
made
a
picture
of
the
greatest
possible
strength
yes
it
was
a
marvellous
creature
but
the
sight
of
him
aroused
a
longing
to
measure
human
strength
with
this
power
of
the
plains
should
i
or
should
i
not
i
could
not
decide
nor
was
i
sure
that
my
roan
would
take
me
towards
him
but
just
then
my
frightened
horse
sprang
forth
from
our
cover
and
i
resolved
to
try
and
spurred
him
towards
the
bull
he
heard
me
coming
and
turned
to
meet
me
lowering
his
head
to
receive
horse
and
rider
on
his
horns
i
heard
sam
cry
out
something
with
all
his
might
but
had
no
time
even
to
glance
at
him
it
was
impossible
to
shoot
the
buffalo
for
in
the
first
place
he
was
not
in
the
right
position
and
in
the
second
place
my
horse
would
not
obey
me
but
for
very
fear
ran
straight
towards
the
threatening
horns
the
buffalo
braced
his
hind
legs
to
toss
us
and
raised
his
head
with
a
mighty
bellow
exerting
all
my
strength
i
turned
my
horse
a
little
and
he
leaped
over
the
bull
while
the
horns
grazed
my
leg
my
course
lay
directly
towards
a
mire
in
which
the
buffalo
had
been
sleeping
i
saw
this
and
fortunately
drew
my
feet
from
the
stirrups
my
horse
slipped
and
we
both
fell
how
it
all
happened
so
quickly
is
incomprehensible
to
me
now
but
the
next
moment
i
stood
upright
beside
the
morass
my
gun
still
in
my
hand
the
buffalo
turned
on
the
horse
which
had
also
risen
quickly
and
came
on
him
in
ungainly
leaps
and
this
brought
his
flank
under
my
fire
i
took
aim
one
more
bound
and
the
buffalo
would
reach
my
horse
i
pulled
the
trigger
he
stopped
whether
from
fear
or
because
he
was
hit
i
did
not
know
but
i
fired
again
two
shots
in
rapid
succession
he
slowly
raised
his
head
froze
my
blood
with
a
last
awful
roar
swayed
from
side
to
side
and
fell
where
he
stood
i
might
have
rejoiced
over
this
narrow
escape
but
i
had
something
else
to
attend
to
i
saw
sam
hawkins
galloping
for
dear
life
across
the
valley
followed
by
a
steer
not
much
smaller
than
my
bull
had
been
when
the
bison
is
aroused
his
speed
is
as
great
as
that
of
a
horse
he
never
gives
up
his
object
and
shows
a
courage
and
perseverance
one
would
not
have
expected
of
him
so
this
steer
was
pressing
the
rider
hard
and
in
order
to
escape
him
sam
had
to
make
many
turns
which
so
wearied
his
horse
that
he
could
not
hold
out
as
long
as
the
buffalo
and
it
was
quite
time
that
help
arrived
i
did
not
stop
to
see
whether
or
not
my
bull
was
dead
i
quickly
reloaded
both
chambers
of
my
gun
and
ran
across
the
grass
towards
sam
he
saw
me
and
turned
his
horse
in
my
direction
this
was
a
great
mistake
for
it
brought
the
horses
side
towards
the
steer
behind
him
i
saw
him
lower
his
horns
and
in
an
instant
horse
and
rider
were
tossed
in
the
air
and
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
dreadful
thud
sam
cried
for
help
as
well
as
he
could
i
was
a
good
hundred
and
fifty
feet
away
but
i
dared
not
delay
though
the
shot
would
have
been
surer
at
shorter
range
i
aimed
at
the
steers
left
shoulderblade
and
fired
the
buffalo
raised
his
head
as
if
listening
turned
slowly
then
ran
at
me
with
all
his
might
luckily
for
me
his
moment
of
hesitation
had
given
me
time
to
reload
and
therefore
i
was
ready
for
him
by
the
time
the
beast
had
made
thirty
paces
towards
me
he
could
no
longer
run
his
steps
became
slow
but
with
deephanging
head
and
protruding
bloodshot
eyes
he
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
me
like
some
awful
unavoidable
fate
i
knelt
down
and
brought
my
gun
into
position
this
movement
made
the
buffalo
halt
and
raise
his
head
a
little
to
see
me
better
thus
bringing
his
eyes
just
in
range
of
both
barrels
i
sent
one
shot
into
the
right
another
into
the
left
eye
a
quick
shudder
went
through
his
body
and
the
beast
fell
dead
springing
to
my
feet
i
rushed
toward
sam
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
i
saw
him
approaching
hallo
i
cried
are
you
alive
very
much
so
only
my
left
hip
pains
me
or
the
right
im
sure
i
cant
tell
which
and
your
horse
done
for
hes
still
alive
but
hes
torn
past
help
well
have
to
shoot
him
to
put
him
out
of
his
misery
poor
fellow
is
the
buffalo
dead
i
was
not
able
to
answer
this
question
positively
so
we
made
sure
that
there
was
no
life
in
my
former
foe
and
hawkins
said
he
treated
me
pretty
badly
this
old
brute
a
cow
would
have
been
gentler
but
i
suppose
you
cant
expect
such
an
old
soldier
to
be
ladylike
let
us
go
to
my
poor
horse
we
found
him
in
a
pitiable
condition
torn
so
that
his
entrails
protruded
and
groaning
with
agony
sam
loaded
and
gave
the
poor
creature
the
shot
that
ended
his
suffering
and
then
he
removed
the
saddle
and
bridle
saying
ill
be
my
own
horse
and
put
these
on
my
back
where
will
you
get
another
horse
i
asked
thats
the
least
of
my
troubles
ill
find
one
unless
im
mistaken
a
mustang
yes
the
buffaloes
are
here
theyve
begun
travelling
southward
and
soon
well
see
the
mustangs
im
sure
of
that
may
i
go
with
you
when
you
catch
one
sure
youll
have
to
learn
to
do
it
i
wonder
if
that
old
bull
is
dead
such
methuselahs
are
wonderfully
tough
but
the
beast
was
dead
as
we
found
on
investigation
and
as
he
lay
there
i
realized
more
fully
what
a
monster
he
was
sam
looked
him
over
shook
his
head
and
said
it
is
perfectly
incredible
do
you
know
what
you
are
what
the
most
reckless
man
on
earth
ive
never
been
accused
of
recklessness
before
well
now
you
know
that
reckless
is
the
word
for
you
i
forbade
you
meddling
with
a
buffalo
or
leaving
your
hidingplace
but
if
you
were
going
to
disobey
me
why
didnt
you
shoot
a
cow
because
this
was
more
knightly
knightly
great
scott
this
tenderfoot
wants
to
play
knight
he
laughed
till
he
had
to
take
hold
of
the
bushes
for
support
and
when
he
got
his
breath
he
cried
the
true
frontiersman
does
what
is
most
expedient
not
whats
most
knightly
and
i
did
that
too
how
do
you
make
that
out
that
big
bull
has
much
more
flesh
on
him
than
a
cow
sam
looked
at
me
mockingly
much
more
flesh
he
cried
and
this
youngster
shot
a
bull
for
his
flesh
why
boy
this
old
stager
had
surely
eighteen
or
twenty
years
on
his
head
and
his
flesh
is
as
hard
as
leather
while
the
cows
flesh
is
fine
and
tender
all
this
shows
again
what
a
greenhorn
you
are
now
go
get
your
horse
and
well
load
him
with
all
the
meat
he
can
carry
in
spite
of
sams
mocking
me
that
night
as
i
stood
unobserved
in
the
door
of
the
tent
where
he
and
stone
and
parker
sat
by
their
fire
i
heard
sam
say
yes
sir
hes
going
to
be
a
genuine
westerner
hes
born
one
and
how
strong
he
is
yesterday
he
drew
our
great
oxcart
alone
and
singlehanded
now
today
i
owe
him
my
life
but
we
wont
let
him
know
what
we
think
of
him
why
not
asked
parker
it
might
swell
his
head
replied
sam
many
a
good
fellow
has
been
spoiled
by
praise
i
suppose
hell
think
im
an
ungrateful
old
curmudgeon
for
i
never
even
thanked
him
for
saving
my
life
but
tomorrow
ill
give
him
a
treat
ill
take
him
to
catch
a
mustang
and
no
matter
what
he
thinks
i
know
how
to
value
him
i
crept
away
pleased
with
what
i
had
heard
and
touched
by
the
loving
tone
of
my
queer
friends
voice
as
he
spoke
of
me
chapter
iii
wild
mustangs
and
longeared
nancy
the
next
morning
as
i
was
going
to
work
sam
came
to
me
saying
put
down
your
instruments
we
have
something
on
hand
more
interesting
than
surveying
what
is
it
youll
see
get
your
horse
ready
were
going
to
ride
and
how
about
the
work
nonsense
youve
done
your
share
however
i
expect
to
be
back
by
noon
and
then
you
can
measure
as
much
as
you
will
after
arranging
with
bancroft
for
my
absence
we
started
and
as
sam
made
a
mystery
of
the
object
of
our
expedition
i
said
nothing
to
show
that
i
suspected
what
it
was
we
went
back
of
the
ravine
where
we
were
surveying
to
a
stretch
of
prairie
which
sam
had
pointed
out
the
day
before
it
was
two
good
miles
broad
and
surrounded
by
woody
heights
from
which
flowed
a
brook
irrigating
the
plain
we
rode
to
the
westerly
boundary
where
the
grass
was
freshest
and
here
sam
securely
tied
his
horsehis
borrowed
horseand
let
him
graze
as
he
looked
about
him
an
expression
of
satisfaction
shone
on
his
rugged
face
like
sunshine
on
rocks
dismount
sir
he
said
and
tie
your
horse
strong
well
wait
here
why
tie
him
so
strongly
i
asked
though
i
knew
well
because
you
might
lose
him
i
have
often
seen
horses
go
off
with
such
companions
such
companions
as
what
i
asked
try
to
guess
mustangs
how
did
you
know
ive
read
that
if
domestic
horses
werent
well
tied
theyd
join
the
wild
ones
when
a
herd
came
along
confound
it
youve
read
so
much
a
man
cant
get
the
best
of
you
do
you
want
to
get
the
best
of
me
of
course
but
look
the
mustangs
have
been
here
are
those
their
tracks
yes
they
went
through
here
yesterday
it
was
a
scouting
party
let
me
tell
you
that
these
beasts
are
uncommonly
sharp
they
always
send
out
little
advanceparties
which
have
their
officers
exactly
like
soldiers
and
the
commander
is
the
strongest
and
most
experienced
horse
they
travel
in
circular
formation
stallions
outside
mares
next
them
inside
and
the
foals
in
the
middle
in
order
that
the
males
may
protect
the
mares
and
young
i
have
already
shown
you
how
to
catch
a
mustang
with
a
lasso
do
you
remember
would
you
like
to
capture
one
certainly
i
would
well
youll
have
a
chance
before
noon
today
thanks
but
i
dont
intend
to
catch
one
the
dickens
you
dont
and
why
not
because
i
dont
need
a
horse
but
a
real
frontiersman
never
asks
whether
he
needs
a
horse
or
not
now
look
here
sam
only
yesterday
you
were
speaking
of
the
brutal
way
the
white
men
though
they
do
not
need
meat
kill
the
buffaloes
in
masses
depriving
the
indians
of
their
food
we
agreed
that
was
a
crime
against
beasts
and
men
assuredly
this
is
a
similar
case
i
should
do
wrong
to
rob
one
of
these
glorious
fellows
of
his
freedom
unless
i
needed
a
horse
thats
well
said
young
man
bravely
said
any
man
any
christian
worth
calling
so
would
feel
thus
but
who
said
anything
about
robbing
him
of
his
freedom
just
put
your
education
in
lassothrowing
to
the
proof
thats
all
thats
a
different
thing
ill
do
that
all
right
and
ill
use
one
in
earnest
for
i
do
need
a
horse
ive
often
told
you
and
now
ill
say
again
sit
strong
in
your
saddle
control
your
horse
well
when
you
feel
the
lasso
tighten
and
pull
for
if
you
dont
youll
be
unseated
and
the
mustang
will
gallop
off
taking
your
horse
and
lasso
with
him
then
youll
lose
your
mount
and
be
like
me
only
a
common
footsoldier
he
was
about
to
give
more
advice
but
stopped
suddenly
and
pointed
to
the
northern
end
of
the
prairie
there
stood
a
horse
one
single
solitary
horse
he
walked
slowly
forward
not
stopping
to
graze
turning
his
head
first
to
one
side
then
to
the
other
snuffing
the
air
as
he
came
do
you
see
whispered
sam
didnt
i
tell
you
theyd
come
thats
the
scout
come
on
ahead
to
see
if
alls
safe
hes
a
wise
beast
see
how
he
looks
in
all
directions
he
wont
discover
us
though
for
we
have
the
wind
towards
us
the
mustang
broke
into
a
trot
running
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
and
finally
turned
and
disappeared
as
we
had
seen
him
come
did
you
see
him
cried
sam
admiringly
how
wise
he
is
an
indian
scout
could
not
have
done
better
thats
so
im
surprised
at
him
now
hes
gone
back
to
tell
his
general
the
air
is
pure
how
we
fooled
him
theyll
all
be
here
shortly
you
ride
back
to
the
other
end
of
the
prairie
and
wait
there
while
i
go
towards
them
and
hide
in
the
trees
when
they
come
ill
chase
them
and
theyll
fly
in
your
direction
then
you
show
yourself
and
theyll
turn
back
towards
me
so
well
drive
them
back
and
forth
till
weve
picked
out
the
two
best
horses
and
well
catch
them
and
choose
between
them
do
you
agree
how
can
you
ask
i
know
nothing
of
the
art
of
mustangcatching
of
which
you
are
past
master
and
ive
nothing
to
do
but
follow
your
directions
all
right
i
have
caught
mustangs
before
today
and
i
hope
youre
not
far
wrong
in
calling
me
a
master
of
that
trade
now
lets
take
our
places
we
turned
and
rode
in
opposite
directions
he
northward
i
southward
to
the
spot
where
we
had
entered
the
prairie
i
got
behind
some
little
trees
made
one
end
of
the
lasso
fast
and
coiled
the
other
ready
for
use
the
further
end
of
the
prairie
was
so
far
off
that
i
could
not
see
the
mustangs
when
they
first
appeared
but
after
i
had
been
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
saw
what
looked
like
a
dark
cloud
rapidly
increasing
in
size
and
advancing
in
my
direction
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
made
up
of
objects
about
as
big
as
sparrows
then
they
seemed
like
cats
dogs
calves
and
at
last
i
saw
them
in
their
own
proportions
they
were
the
mustangs
in
wild
gallop
coming
towards
me
what
a
sight
these
lordly
beasts
were
with
their
manes
flying
about
their
necks
and
their
tails
streaming
like
plumes
in
the
wind
there
were
at
least
three
hundred
head
and
the
earth
seemed
to
tremble
beneath
the
pounding
of
their
hoofs
a
white
stallion
led
them
a
noble
creature
that
any
man
might
be
glad
to
capture
only
no
prairie
hunter
would
ride
a
white
horse
for
he
would
be
too
conspicuous
to
his
enemies
now
was
the
time
to
show
myself
i
came
out
and
the
startled
leader
sprang
back
as
though
an
arrow
had
pierced
him
the
herd
halted
one
loud
eager
whinny
from
the
white
stallion
which
plainly
meant
wheel
squadron
and
the
splendid
fellow
turned
followed
by
all
his
companions
and
tore
back
whence
they
had
come
i
followed
slowly
there
was
no
hurry
for
i
knew
sam
hawkins
would
drive
them
back
to
me
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
was
right
in
what
i
had
seen
for
in
the
brief
instant
the
herd
had
halted
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
of
them
was
not
a
horse
but
a
mule
the
animal
that
i
thought
a
mule
had
been
in
the
front
ranks
immediately
behind
the
leader
and
so
seemed
not
merely
to
be
tolerated
by
its
companions
but
to
hold
honorable
rank
among
them
once
again
the
herd
came
towards
me
and
i
saw
that
i
was
not
mistaken
but
that
a
mule
really
was
among
them
a
mule
of
a
delicate
light
brown
color
with
dark
backstripe
and
which
i
thought
had
the
biggest
head
and
the
longest
ears
i
had
ever
seen
mules
are
more
suitable
for
rough
mountainriding
than
horses
are
surerfooted
and
less
likely
to
fall
into
abyssesa
fact
worth
consideration
to
be
sure
they
are
obstinate
and
i
have
known
a
mule
be
beaten
half
to
death
rather
than
take
another
step
not
because
it
was
overladen
or
the
way
was
hard
but
simply
because
it
would
not
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
mule
showed
more
spirit
than
the
horses
and
that
its
eyes
gleamed
brighter
and
more
intelligently
than
theirs
and
i
resolved
to
capture
it
evidently
it
had
escaped
from
its
former
owner
and
joined
the
mustangs
now
once
more
sam
turned
the
herd
and
we
had
approached
each
other
till
i
could
see
him
the
mustangs
could
no
longer
run
back
and
forth
they
turned
to
the
side
we
following
them
the
herd
had
divided
and
i
saw
that
the
mule
was
with
the
more
important
part
still
keeping
beside
the
white
horse
and
proving
itself
an
unusually
strong
and
swift
animal
i
pursued
this
band
and
sam
seemed
to
have
the
same
design
get
around
them
i
left
you
right
he
shouted
we
spurred
our
horses
and
not
only
kept
up
with
the
mustangs
but
rode
so
swiftly
that
we
headed
them
off
from
the
woods
they
began
to
scatter
to
all
sides
like
chickens
when
a
hawk
swoops
down
among
them
and
as
we
both
chased
the
white
stallion
and
the
mule
sam
cried
youll
always
be
a
greenhorn
who
else
would
pick
out
a
white
horse
i
answered
him
but
his
loud
laugh
drowned
my
reply
and
if
he
thought
i
was
after
the
white
horse
it
did
not
much
matter
i
left
the
mule
to
his
tender
care
and
in
a
moment
he
had
come
so
near
her
that
he
threw
the
lasso
the
noose
encircled
the
beasts
neck
and
now
sam
had
to
hold
on
as
he
had
directed
me
to
do
and
throw
himself
backward
to
make
the
lasso
hold
when
it
tautened
this
he
did
but
a
moment
too
late
his
horse
did
not
obey
on
the
instant
and
was
thrown
by
the
force
of
the
jerk
sam
flew
through
the
air
and
landed
on
the
ground
with
a
thump
the
horse
shook
himself
free
and
was
up
and
off
in
a
moment
and
the
mule
with
him
since
the
lasso
was
fast
to
the
saddlebow
i
hastened
to
see
if
sam
was
hurt
and
found
him
standing
much
shaken
but
not
otherwise
the
worse
he
said
to
me
in
mournful
tones
there
go
dick
stones
chestnut
and
the
mule
without
saying
goodby
are
you
hurt
no
jump
down
and
give
me
your
horse
what
for
to
catch
them
of
course
hurry
up
not
much
you
might
turn
another
somersault
and
then
both
our
horses
would
be
gone
to
the
four
winds
with
these
words
i
put
my
horse
after
the
mule
and
dicks
horse
already
they
were
in
trouble
one
pulling
one
way
the
other
another
and
held
together
by
the
lasso
so
i
could
easily
come
up
with
them
it
never
entered
my
head
to
use
my
lasso
but
i
grabbed
the
one
holding
them
wound
it
around
my
hand
and
felt
sure
the
day
was
won
i
drew
the
noose
tighter
and
tighter
thus
easily
controlling
the
mule
and
brought
her
back
together
with
the
horse
in
apparent
subjection
to
where
sam
stood
then
i
suddenly
pulled
the
noose
taut
when
the
mule
lost
her
breath
and
fell
to
the
ground
hold
on
fast
till
i
have
the
rascal
and
then
let
go
shouted
sam
springing
to
the
side
of
the
prostrate
beast
now
he
cried
i
let
go
the
lasso
and
the
mule
instantly
jumped
up
but
not
before
sam
was
on
her
back
she
stood
motionless
a
moment
in
surprise
then
rushed
from
side
to
side
then
stood
first
on
her
hind
legs
then
on
her
fore
legs
and
finally
jumped
into
the
air
with
all
four
bunched
together
and
her
back
arched
like
a
cats
but
still
little
sam
sat
fast
dont
get
near
shes
going
to
try
her
last
hope
and
run
away
but
ill
bring
her
back
tamed
shouted
sam
he
proved
to
be
mistaken
however
she
only
ran
a
little
way
and
then
deliberately
lay
down
and
rolled
this
was
too
much
for
sams
ribs
he
had
to
get
out
of
the
saddle
i
jumped
from
my
horse
seized
the
lasso
and
wound
it
around
some
tough
roots
near
at
hand
the
mule
finding
she
had
no
rider
got
up
and
started
to
run
off
but
the
roots
were
strong
the
noose
drew
tight
and
again
the
animal
fell
sam
had
retired
to
one
side
feeling
his
legs
and
ribs
and
making
a
face
as
if
he
had
eaten
sauerkraut
and
marmalade
let
the
beast
go
he
said
i
believe
nobody
can
conquer
her
well
i
guess
not
said
i
no
animal
whose
father
was
no
gentleman
but
a
donkey
is
going
to
shame
me
shes
got
to
mind
me
look
out
i
unwound
the
lasso
from
the
bushes
and
stood
astride
the
mule
which
at
once
got
up
feeling
herself
freed
now
it
was
a
question
of
strength
of
legs
and
in
this
i
far
surpassed
sam
if
a
rider
presses
his
beasts
ribs
with
strong
knees
it
causes
intense
pain
as
the
mule
began
to
try
to
throw
me
as
she
had
sam
i
caught
up
the
lasso
half
hanging
on
the
ground
and
fastened
it
tight
behind
the
noose
this
i
drew
whenever
she
began
any
of
her
tricks
and
by
this
means
and
pressure
of
the
knees
i
contrived
to
keep
her
on
all
fours
it
was
a
bitter
struggle
strength
against
strength
i
began
to
sweat
from
every
pore
but
the
mule
was
dripping
and
foam
fell
from
her
lips
in
great
flakes
her
struggles
grew
more
and
more
feeble
her
heavy
breathing
became
short
gasps
till
at
last
she
gave
in
altogether
not
willingly
but
because
she
was
at
her
last
limit
and
stood
motionless
with
bulging
eyes
i
drew
long
deep
breaths
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
every
bone
and
sinew
in
my
body
were
broken
heavens
what
a
man
you
are
cried
sam
youre
stronger
than
the
brute
if
you
could
see
your
face
you
would
be
scared
your
eyes
are
staring
your
lips
are
swollen
your
cheeks
are
actually
blue
i
suppose
so
that
comes
of
being
a
tenderfoot
who
wont
be
beaten
while
his
teacher
gives
in
and
lets
a
horse
and
a
mule
conquer
him
sam
made
a
wry
face
now
let
up
young
fellow
i
tell
you
the
best
hunter
gets
whipped
sometimes
very
likely
how
are
your
ribs
and
other
little
bones
i
dont
know
ill
have
to
count
em
to
find
out
thats
a
fine
beast
you
have
under
you
there
she
is
indeed
see
how
patiently
she
stands
one
feels
sorry
for
her
shall
we
saddle
and
bridle
her
and
go
back
the
poor
mule
stood
quiet
trembling
in
every
limb
nor
did
she
try
to
resist
when
we
put
saddle
and
bridle
on
her
but
obeyed
the
bit
like
a
wellbroken
horse
shes
had
a
master
before
said
sam
im
going
to
call
her
nancy
for
i
once
had
a
mule
by
that
name
and
its
too
much
trouble
to
get
used
to
another
and
im
going
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favor
gladly
what
is
it
dont
tell
at
the
camp
what
has
happened
this
morning
for
theyd
have
nine
days
sport
with
me
of
course
i
wont
youre
my
teacher
and
friend
so
ill
keep
your
secrets
his
queer
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
yes
im
your
friend
and
if
i
knew
you
had
a
little
liking
for
me
my
old
heart
would
be
warmed
and
rejoiced
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
him
surprised
and
touched
i
can
easily
give
you
that
pleasure
dear
sam
i
said
you
may
be
sure
i
honestly
care
for
you
with
real
respect
and
affection
he
shook
my
hand
looking
so
delighted
that
even
my
young
selfsufficiency
could
perceive
how
lonely
this
rough
cranky
old
frontiersman
was
and
how
great
was
his
yearning
for
human
sympathy
i
fastened
dick
stones
horse
with
the
lasso
and
mounting
mine
as
sam
got
on
nancy
we
rode
away
shes
been
educated
this
new
nancy
in
a
very
good
school
sam
remarked
presently
i
see
at
every
step
she
is
going
to
be
all
right
and
is
regaining
the
old
knowledge
which
she
had
forgotten
among
the
mustangs
i
hope
she
has
not
only
temperament
but
character
weve
had
two
good
days
sam
i
said
bad
ones
for
me
except
in
getting
nancy
and
bad
for
you
too
in
one
way
but
mighty
honorable
oh
ive
done
nothing
i
came
west
to
get
experience
i
hope
to
have
a
chance
at
other
sport
well
i
hope
it
will
come
more
easily
yesterday
your
life
hung
by
a
hair
you
risked
too
much
never
forget
youre
a
greenhorn
tenderfoot
the
idea
of
creeping
up
to
shoot
a
buffalo
in
the
eye
did
ever
any
one
hear
the
like
but
though
hunting
buffaloes
is
dangerous
bearhunting
is
far
more
so
black
bear
nonsense
the
grizzly
youve
read
of
him
yes
well
be
glad
you
dont
know
him
outside
of
books
and
take
care
you
dont
for
you
might
have
a
chance
to
meet
him
he
sometimes
comes
about
such
places
as
this
following
the
rivers
even
as
far
as
the
prairie
ill
tell
you
more
of
him
another
time
here
we
are
at
the
camp
a
mule
a
mule
where
did
you
get
her
hawkins
cried
all
the
men
by
special
delivery
from
washington
for
a
tencent
stamp
would
you
like
to
see
the
envelope
asked
sam
dismounting
though
they
were
curious
none
asked
further
questions
for
like
the
beast
he
had
captured
when
sam
wouldnt
he
wouldnt
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
chapter
iv
a
grizzly
and
a
meeting
the
morning
after
sam
and
i
had
caught
miss
nancy
we
moved
our
camp
onward
to
begin
labor
on
the
next
section
of
the
road
hawkins
stone
and
parker
did
not
help
in
this
for
sam
was
anxious
to
experiment
further
with
nancys
education
and
the
other
two
accompanied
him
to
the
prairie
where
they
had
sufficient
room
to
carry
out
this
purpose
we
surveyors
transferred
our
instruments
ourselves
helped
by
one
of
rattlers
men
while
rattler
himself
loafed
around
doing
nothing
we
came
to
the
spot
where
i
had
killed
the
two
buffaloes
and
to
my
surprise
i
saw
that
the
body
of
the
old
bull
was
gone
leaving
a
broad
trail
of
crushed
grass
that
led
to
the
adjoining
thicket
i
thought
you
had
made
sure
both
bulls
were
dead
rattler
exclaimed
the
big
one
must
have
had
some
life
in
him
think
so
i
asked
of
course
unless
you
think
a
dead
buffalo
can
take
himself
off
must
he
have
taken
himself
off
perhaps
it
was
done
for
him
yes
but
who
did
it
possibly
indians
we
saw
an
indians
footprint
over
yonder
you
dont
say
how
well
a
greenhorn
can
explain
things
sneered
rattler
if
it
was
done
by
indians
where
do
you
think
they
came
from
dropped
from
the
skies
because
if
they
came
from
anywhere
else
wed
see
their
tracks
no
there
was
life
in
that
buffalo
and
he
crawled
into
the
thicket
where
he
must
have
died
im
going
to
look
for
him
he
started
off
followed
by
his
men
he
may
have
expected
me
to
go
too
but
it
was
far
from
my
thoughts
for
i
did
not
like
the
way
he
had
spoken
i
wanted
to
work
and
did
not
care
a
button
what
had
become
of
the
old
bull
so
i
went
back
to
my
employment
and
had
only
just
taken
up
the
measuringrod
when
a
cry
of
horror
rang
from
the
thicket
two
three
shots
echoed
and
then
i
heard
rattler
cry
up
the
tree
quick
up
the
tree
or
youre
lost
he
cant
climb
who
could
not
climb
one
of
rattlers
men
burst
out
of
the
thicket
writhing
like
one
in
mortal
agony
what
is
it
whats
happened
i
shouted
a
bear
a
tremendous
grizzly
bear
he
gasped
as
i
ran
up
to
him
and
within
the
thicket
an
agonized
voice
cried
help
help
hes
got
me
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
saw
the
jaws
of
death
yawning
before
him
evidently
the
man
was
in
extreme
danger
and
must
be
helped
quickly
but
how
i
had
left
my
gun
in
the
tent
for
in
working
it
hindered
me
nor
was
this
an
oversight
since
we
surveyors
had
the
frontiersmen
purposely
to
guard
us
at
our
work
if
i
went
to
the
tent
to
get
the
gun
the
bear
would
have
torn
the
man
to
shreds
before
i
could
get
back
i
must
go
to
him
as
i
was
with
a
knife
and
two
revolvers
stuck
in
my
belt
and
what
were
these
against
a
grizzly
bear
the
grizzly
is
a
near
relation
of
the
extinct
cavebear
and
really
belongs
more
to
primeval
days
than
to
the
present
it
grows
to
a
great
size
and
its
strength
is
such
that
it
can
easily
carry
off
a
deer
a
colt
or
a
young
buffalo
cow
in
its
jaws
the
indians
hold
the
killing
of
a
grizzly
a
brilliant
feat
because
of
its
absolute
fearlessness
and
inexhaustible
endurance
so
it
was
to
meet
such
a
foe
that
i
sprang
into
the
thicket
the
trail
led
further
within
where
the
trees
began
and
where
the
bear
had
dragged
the
buffalo
it
was
a
dreadful
moment
behind
me
i
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
engineers
before
me
were
the
frontiersmen
screaming
and
between
them
and
me
in
indescribable
agony
was
their
companion
whom
the
bear
had
seized
i
pushed
further
in
and
heard
the
voice
of
the
bear
for
though
this
mighty
beast
differs
from
others
of
the
bear
family
in
not
growling
when
in
pain
or
anger
it
utters
something
like
a
loud
harsh
breathing
and
grunting
and
now
i
was
on
the
scene
before
me
lay
the
torn
body
of
the
buffalo
to
right
and
left
were
the
men
who
were
comparatively
safe
having
taken
to
the
trees
which
a
grizzly
bear
seldom
has
been
known
to
climb
if
ever
one
of
the
men
had
tried
to
get
up
a
tree
like
the
others
but
had
been
overtaken
by
the
bear
he
hung
by
both
arms
hooked
to
the
lowest
limb
while
the
grizzly
reached
up
and
held
him
fast
with
its
fore
paws
around
the
lower
part
of
his
body
the
man
was
almost
dead
his
case
was
hopeless
i
could
not
help
him
and
no
one
could
have
blamed
me
if
i
had
gone
away
and
saved
myself
but
the
desperation
of
the
moment
seemed
to
impel
me
onward
i
snatched
up
a
discarded
gun
only
to
find
it
already
emptied
taking
it
by
the
muzzle
i
sprang
over
the
buffalo
and
dealt
the
bear
a
blow
on
the
skull
with
all
my
might
the
gun
shattered
like
glass
in
my
hand
even
a
blow
with
a
battleaxe
would
have
no
effect
on
such
a
skull
but
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
distracting
the
grizzlys
attention
from
its
victim
it
turned
its
head
toward
me
not
quickly
like
a
wild
beast
of
the
feline
or
canine
family
but
slowly
as
if
wondering
at
my
stupidity
it
seemed
to
measure
me
with
its
little
eyes
deciding
between
going
at
me
or
sticking
to
its
victim
and
to
this
slight
hesitation
i
owe
my
life
for
in
that
instant
the
only
possible
way
to
save
myself
came
to
me
i
drew
a
revolver
sprang
directly
at
the
bear
and
shot
it
once
twice
thrice
straight
in
the
eyes
as
i
had
the
buffalo
of
course
this
was
rapidly
done
and
at
once
i
jumped
to
one
side
and
stood
still
with
my
knife
drawn
had
i
remained
where
i
was
my
life
would
have
paid
for
my
rashness
for
the
blinded
beast
turned
quickly
from
the
tree
and
threw
itself
on
the
spot
where
i
had
stood
a
moment
before
i
was
not
there
and
the
bear
sought
me
with
angry
mutterings
and
heavy
breathing
it
wheeled
around
like
a
mad
thing
hugged
itself
rose
on
its
hind
legs
reaching
and
springing
all
around
to
find
me
but
fortunately
i
was
out
of
reach
its
sense
of
smell
would
have
guided
it
to
me
but
it
was
mad
with
rage
and
pain
and
this
prevented
its
instinct
from
serving
it
at
last
it
turned
its
attention
more
to
its
misfortune
than
to
him
who
had
caused
it
it
sat
down
and
with
sobs
and
gnashing
of
teeth
laid
its
fore
paws
over
its
eyes
i
was
sorry
that
necessity
for
saving
human
life
was
causing
the
big
fellow
such
pain
and
with
pity
for
it
as
well
as
desire
for
my
own
safety
tried
to
make
it
short
quickly
i
stood
beside
it
and
stabbed
it
twice
between
the
ribs
instantly
it
grabbed
for
me
but
once
more
i
sprang
out
of
the
way
i
had
not
pierced
its
heart
and
it
began
seeking
me
with
redoubled
fury
this
continued
for
fully
ten
minutes
it
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
blood
and
evidently
was
dying
it
sat
down
again
to
mourn
its
poor
lost
eyes
this
gave
me
a
chance
for
two
rapidly
repeated
knifethrusts
and
this
time
i
aimed
better
it
sank
forward
as
again
i
sprang
aloof
made
a
feeble
step
to
one
side
then
back
tried
to
rise
but
had
not
sufficient
strength
swayed
back
and
forth
in
trying
to
get
on
its
feet
and
then
stretched
out
and
was
still
thank
god
cried
rattler
from
his
tree
the
beast
is
dead
that
was
a
close
call
we
had
i
dont
see
that
it
was
a
close
call
for
you
i
replied
you
took
good
care
of
your
own
safety
now
you
can
come
down
not
yet
you
make
sure
its
truly
dead
it
is
dead
you
dont
know
you
havent
an
idea
how
tough
such
a
creature
is
go
examine
it
if
you
doubt
me
examine
it
yourself
youre
an
experienced
frontiersman
and
im
a
tenderfoot
you
know
so
saying
i
turned
to
his
comrade
who
still
hung
on
the
tree
in
on
awful
plight
his
face
was
torn
and
his
wideopen
eyes
were
glassy
the
flesh
was
stripped
from
the
bones
of
his
legs
and
he
was
partly
disembowelled
i
conquered
the
horror
of
the
sight
enough
to
say
let
go
my
poor
fellow
i
will
take
you
down
he
did
not
answer
or
show
any
sign
of
having
heard
me
and
i
called
his
comrades
to
help
me
only
after
i
had
made
sure
the
bear
was
dead
would
the
courageous
gang
come
down
from
their
trees
when
we
gently
removed
the
wounded
man
this
required
strength
to
accomplish
for
his
arms
had
wound
tightly
around
the
tree
and
stiffened
there
he
was
dead
this
horrible
end
did
not
seem
to
affect
his
companions
in
the
least
for
they
turned
from
him
to
the
bear
and
their
leader
said
now
things
are
reversed
the
bear
meant
to
eat
us
but
we
will
eat
it
quick
you
fellows
take
its
pelt
and
let
us
get
at
the
paws
and
steak
he
drew
his
knife
and
knelt
down
to
carry
out
his
words
but
i
checked
him
it
would
have
been
more
fitting
if
you
had
used
your
knife
when
it
was
alive
now
its
too
late
dont
give
yourself
the
trouble
what
he
cried
do
you
mean
to
hinder
me
most
emphatically
i
do
mr
rattler
by
what
right
by
the
most
indisputable
right
i
killed
that
bear
thats
not
so
maybe
you
think
a
greenhorn
can
kill
a
grizzly
with
a
knife
as
soon
as
we
saw
it
we
shot
it
and
immediately
got
up
a
tree
yes
thats
very
true
you
bet
its
true
and
our
shots
killed
it
not
the
two
little
needlepricks
of
your
knife
the
bear
is
ours
and
well
do
with
it
what
we
like
understand
he
started
to
work
again
but
i
said
coolly
stop
this
minute
rattler
ill
teach
you
to
respect
my
words
do
you
understand
and
as
he
bent
forward
to
stick
the
knife
into
the
bears
hide
i
put
both
arms
around
his
hips
and
raising
him
threw
him
against
the
next
tree
so
hard
that
it
cracked
i
was
too
angry
just
then
to
care
whether
he
or
the
tree
broke
and
as
he
flew
across
the
space
i
drew
my
second
and
unused
revolver
to
be
ready
for
the
next
move
he
got
up
looked
at
me
with
eyes
blazing
with
rage
drew
his
knife
and
cried
you
shall
pay
for
this
you
knocked
me
down
once
before
ill
see
it
doesnt
happen
a
third
time
he
made
a
step
towards
me
but
i
covered
him
with
my
pistol
saying
one
step
more
and
youll
have
a
bullet
in
your
head
drop
that
knife
when
i
say
three
ill
shoot
you
if
you
still
hold
it
now
one
two
he
held
the
knife
tight
and
i
should
have
shot
him
not
in
the
head
but
in
the
hand
for
he
had
to
learn
to
respect
me
but
luckily
i
did
not
get
so
far
for
at
this
moment
a
loud
voice
cried
men
are
you
mad
what
reason
have
the
whites
to
tear
out
one
anothers
eyes
stop
we
looked
in
the
direction
whence
the
voice
came
and
saw
a
man
appearing
from
behind
the
trees
he
was
small
thin
and
hunchbacked
clad
and
armed
like
a
red
man
one
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
an
indian
or
a
white
his
sharpcut
features
indicated
the
former
while
the
tint
of
his
face
although
sunburned
was
that
of
a
white
man
he
was
bareheaded
and
his
dark
hair
hung
to
his
shoulders
he
wore
leather
trousers
a
huntingshirt
of
the
same
material
and
moccasins
and
was
armed
with
a
knife
and
gun
his
eyes
shone
with
unusual
intelligence
and
there
was
nothing
ridiculous
in
his
deformity
indeed
none
but
stupid
and
brutal
men
ever
laugh
at
bodily
defects
but
rattler
was
of
this
class
for
as
soon
as
he
looked
at
the
newcomer
he
cried
hallo
what
kind
of
a
freak
comes
here
do
such
queer
things
grow
in
the
big
west
the
stranger
looked
at
him
calmly
and
answered
quietly
thank
god
that
your
limbs
are
sound
it
is
by
the
heart
and
soul
that
men
are
judged
and
i
should
not
fear
a
comparison
with
you
in
those
respects
he
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
and
turned
to
me
saying
you
are
strong
young
sir
it
is
not
every
one
can
send
a
man
flying
through
the
air
as
you
did
just
now
it
was
wonderful
to
see
then
touching
the
grizzly
with
his
foot
he
added
and
this
is
the
game
we
wanted
but
we
came
too
late
we
discovered
its
tracks
yesterday
and
followed
over
hill
and
dale
through
thick
and
thin
only
to
find
the
work
done
when
we
came
up
with
it
you
speak
in
the
plural
are
you
not
alone
i
asked
no
i
have
two
companions
with
me
but
before
i
tell
you
who
they
are
will
you
introduce
yourselves
you
know
one
cannot
be
too
cautious
here
where
we
meet
more
bad
men
than
good
ones
he
glanced
significantly
at
rattler
and
his
followers
but
instantly
added
in
a
friendly
tone
however
one
can
tell
a
gentleman
that
can
be
trusted
i
heard
the
last
part
of
your
discussion
and
know
pretty
well
where
i
stand
we
are
surveyors
sir
i
explained
we
are
locating
a
railroad
to
go
through
here
surveyors
have
you
purchased
the
right
to
build
your
road
his
face
became
stern
as
he
asked
the
question
for
which
he
seemed
to
have
some
reason
so
i
replied
i
have
occupied
myself
with
my
task
and
never
thought
of
asking
ah
yes
but
you
must
know
where
you
are
consider
these
lands
whereon
we
stand
are
the
property
of
the
indians
they
belong
to
the
apaches
of
the
mascaleros
tribe
i
am
sure
if
you
are
sent
to
survey
the
ground
is
being
marked
out
by
the
whites
for
some
one
else
what
is
that
to
you
rattler
cried
dont
bother
yourself
with
the
affairs
of
others
any
one
can
see
you
are
a
white
man
i
am
an
apache
one
of
the
mascaleros
the
stranger
said
quietly
i
am
klekipetrah
this
name
in
the
apache
tongue
is
equivalent
to
white
father
and
rattler
seemed
to
have
heard
it
before
he
bowed
with
mock
deference
and
said
ah
klekipetrah
the
venerated
schoolmaster
of
the
apaches
its
a
pity
you
are
deformed
for
it
must
annoy
you
to
be
laughed
at
by
the
braves
they
never
do
that
sir
wellbred
people
are
not
amused
by
such
things
and
the
braves
are
gentlemen
since
i
know
who
you
are
and
why
you
are
here
i
will
tell
you
who
my
companions
are
or
perhaps
you
had
better
meet
them
he
called
in
the
indian
tongue
and
two
extraordinarily
interesting
figures
appeared
and
came
slowly
towards
us
they
were
indians
father
and
son
as
one
could
see
at
the
first
glance
the
elder
was
a
little
above
medium
height
very
strongly
built
his
air
was
truly
noble
his
earnest
face
was
of
pure
indian
type
but
not
so
sharp
and
keen
as
that
of
most
red
men
his
eyes
had
a
calm
gentle
expression
like
one
much
given
to
contemplation
his
head
was
bare
his
hair
worn
in
a
knot
in
which
was
stuck
an
eagles
feather
the
badge
of
chieftainship
his
dress
consisted
of
moccasins
leather
leggings
and
huntingjacket
very
simple
and
unadorned
from
his
belt
in
which
a
knife
was
thrust
hung
all
the
appointments
necessary
to
a
dweller
on
the
plains
a
medicinecharm
with
sacred
inscriptions
cut
around
its
face
hung
from
his
neck
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
doublebarrelled
gun
the
handle
adorned
with
silver
nails
the
younger
man
was
clad
like
his
father
except
that
his
garments
were
showier
his
leggings
were
beautifully
fringed
and
his
huntingshirt
was
embellished
with
scarlet
needlework
he
also
wore
a
medicinecharm
around
his
neck
and
a
calumet
like
his
father
he
was
armed
with
a
knife
and
a
doublebarrelled
gun
he
too
was
bareheaded
his
hair
bound
in
a
knot
but
without
the
feather
it
was
so
long
that
the
end
below
the
knot
fell
thick
and
heavy
on
his
shoulders
and
many
a
fine
lady
might
have
coveted
it
his
face
was
even
nobler
than
his
fathers
its
color
a
light
brown
with
a
touch
of
bronze
he
seemed
to
be
as
i
afterwards
learned
he
was
of
the
same
age
as
myself
and
his
appearance
made
as
profound
an
impression
on
me
then
when
i
saw
him
first
as
his
character
has
left
upon
me
today
after
our
long
friendship
we
looked
at
one
another
long
and
searchingly
and
i
thought
i
saw
for
a
moment
in
his
earnest
dark
eyes
a
friendly
light
gleam
upon
me
these
are
my
friends
and
companions
said
klekipetrah
introducing
first
the
father
then
the
son
this
is
intschutschuna
good
sun
the
chief
of
the
mascaleros
whom
all
apaches
acknowledge
as
their
head
and
here
stands
his
son
winnetou
who
already
in
his
youth
has
accomplished
more
deeds
of
renown
than
any
ten
old
warriors
have
in
all
their
lives
his
name
will
be
known
and
honored
as
far
as
the
prairies
and
rockies
extend
this
sounded
like
exaggeration
but
later
i
found
that
he
had
spoken
only
the
truth
rattler
laughed
insultingly
and
said
so
young
a
fellow
and
committed
such
deeds
i
say
committed
purposely
for
every
one
knows
they
are
only
deeds
of
robbery
and
cruelty
the
red
men
steal
from
every
one
this
was
an
outrageous
insult
but
the
indians
acted
as
though
they
had
not
heard
it
stooping
down
over
the
bear
klekipetrah
admired
it
calling
winnetous
attention
to
its
size
and
strength
it
was
killed
by
a
knife
and
not
a
bullet
he
said
as
he
rose
evidently
i
thought
he
had
heard
the
dispute
and
wished
me
to
have
justice
what
does
a
schoolmaster
know
of
bearhunting
said
rattler
when
we
take
the
skin
off
we
can
see
what
killed
him
i
wont
be
robbed
of
my
rights
by
a
greenhorn
then
winnetou
bent
down
touched
the
bloody
wound
and
asked
me
in
good
english
who
stabbed
the
beast
i
did
i
replied
why
did
not
my
young
white
brother
shoot
him
because
i
had
no
gun
with
me
yet
here
are
guns
they
are
not
mine
they
were
thrown
away
by
these
men
when
they
climbed
the
trees
shrieking
with
terror
ugh
the
low
cowards
and
dogs
to
fly
like
tissuepaper
a
man
should
make
resistance
for
if
he
has
courage
he
may
conquer
the
strongest
brute
my
young
white
brother
has
such
courage
my
son
speaks
truly
added
the
father
in
as
perfect
english
this
brave
young
paleface
is
no
longer
a
greenhorn
he
who
kills
a
grizzly
in
this
manner
is
a
hero
and
he
who
does
it
to
save
those
who
climb
trees
deserves
thanks
not
insults
let
us
go
to
visit
the
palefaces
that
have
come
into
our
dominion
they
were
but
three
and
did
not
know
how
many
we
numbered
but
that
never
occurred
to
them
with
slow
and
dignified
strides
they
went
out
of
the
thicket
we
following
then
for
the
first
time
intschutschuna
saw
the
surveying
instruments
standing
as
we
had
left
them
and
stopping
suddenly
he
turned
to
me
demanding
what
is
this
are
the
palefaces
measuring
the
land
yes
i
answered
why
for
a
railroad
his
eyes
lost
their
calmness
and
he
asked
sternly
do
you
obey
these
people
and
measure
with
them
yes
and
are
paid
for
it
yes
he
threw
a
scornful
glance
upon
me
and
in
a
contemptuous
tone
he
said
to
klekipetrah
your
teachings
sound
well
but
they
do
not
often
agree
with
what
i
see
christians
deceive
and
rob
the
indians
here
is
a
young
paleface
with
a
brave
heart
open
face
honorable
eyes
and
when
i
ask
what
he
does
here
he
tells
me
he
has
come
to
steal
our
land
the
faces
of
the
white
men
are
good
and
bad
but
inside
they
are
all
alike
to
be
honest
his
words
filled
me
with
shame
could
i
well
be
proud
of
my
share
in
this
matteri
a
catholic
who
had
been
taught
so
early
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbors
goods
i
blushed
for
my
race
and
for
myself
before
this
fine
savage
and
before
i
could
rally
enough
even
to
try
to
reply
the
head
engineer
who
had
been
watching
us
through
a
hole
in
the
tent
came
forth
to
meet
us
and
my
thoughts
were
diverted
by
what
then
took
place
chapter
v
the
speech
of
the
apache
chief
the
first
question
the
head
engineer
asked
as
we
came
up
although
he
was
surprised
to
see
the
indians
with
us
was
what
had
become
of
the
bear
rattler
instantly
replied
weve
shot
him
and
well
have
bearpaws
for
dinner
and
bearsteak
tonight
for
supper
our
three
guests
looked
at
me
as
if
to
see
whether
i
would
let
this
pass
and
i
said
i
claim
to
have
stabbed
the
bear
here
are
three
witnesses
who
have
corroborated
my
statement
but
well
wait
till
hawkins
stone
and
parker
come
and
they
will
give
their
opinion
by
which
we
will
be
guided
till
then
the
bear
must
lie
untouched
not
much
will
i
leave
it
to
the
scouts
growled
rattler
ill
go
with
my
men
and
cut
up
the
bear
and
whoever
tries
to
hinder
us
will
be
driven
off
with
a
dozen
shots
in
his
body
hold
on
mr
rattler
said
i
im
not
as
much
afraid
of
your
shots
as
you
were
of
the
bear
you
wont
drive
me
up
a
tree
with
your
threats
i
recommend
you
to
bury
your
dead
comrade
i
would
not
leave
him
lying
thus
is
some
one
dead
asked
bancroft
startled
yes
rollins
rattler
replied
the
poor
fellow
had
jumped
for
a
tree
like
the
rest
of
us
and
would
have
been
all
right
but
this
greenhorn
came
up
excited
the
bear
and
it
tore
rollins
horribly
i
stood
speechless
with
amazement
that
he
should
dare
go
so
far
it
was
impossible
to
endure
such
lying
and
in
my
very
presence
i
turned
on
rattler
and
demanded
do
you
mean
to
say
rollins
was
escaping
and
i
prevented
it
yes
he
nodded
drawing
his
revolver
and
i
say
the
bear
had
seized
him
before
i
came
thats
a
lie
said
rattler
very
well
heres
a
truth
for
you
and
with
these
words
i
knocked
his
revolver
from
his
hand
with
my
left
and
with
the
right
gave
him
such
a
blow
on
the
ear
that
he
staggered
six
or
eight
feet
away
and
fell
flat
on
the
ground
he
sprang
up
drew
his
knife
and
came
at
me
raging
like
a
wild
beast
i
parried
the
knifethrust
with
my
left
hand
and
with
my
right
laid
him
senseless
at
my
feet
ugh
ugh
grunted
intschutschuna
surprised
into
admiration
which
his
race
rarely
betray
that
was
shatterhand
again
said
wheeler
the
surveyor
i
kept
my
eye
on
rattlers
comrades
they
were
angry
but
no
one
dared
attack
me
and
though
they
muttered
among
themselves
they
did
no
more
you
must
send
rattler
away
mr
bancroft
i
said
i
have
done
nothing
to
him
yet
he
constantly
seeks
a
quarrel
with
me
i
am
afraid
hell
make
serious
trouble
in
the
camp
send
him
away
or
if
you
prefer
ill
go
myself
oh
things
arent
as
bad
as
that
said
bancroft
easily
yes
they
are
just
as
bad
as
that
here
are
his
knife
and
revolver
dont
let
him
have
them
for
i
warn
you
theyd
not
be
in
good
hands
just
as
i
spoke
these
words
our
three
scouts
joined
us
and
having
heard
the
story
of
rattlers
lying
claim
and
my
counterstatement
they
set
off
at
once
to
examine
the
bears
carcass
to
settle
the
dispute
they
returned
in
a
short
time
and
as
soon
as
he
was
within
hailing
distance
sam
called
out
what
idiocy
it
was
to
shoot
a
grizzly
and
then
run
if
a
man
doesnt
intend
making
a
fight
then
what
on
earth
does
he
shoot
for
why
doesnt
he
leave
the
bear
in
peace
you
cant
treat
grizzlies
like
poodledogs
poor
rollins
paid
dear
for
it
though
now
who
killed
that
bear
did
you
say
i
did
cried
rattler
who
had
come
to
i
killed
him
with
my
gun
well
that
agrees
thats
all
right
the
bear
was
shot
do
you
hear
that
men
sam
hawkins
has
decided
for
me
cried
rattler
triumphantly
yes
for
you
said
sam
you
shot
him
and
took
off
the
tip
of
his
ear
and
such
a
loss
naturally
ended
the
grizzly
ha
ha
ha
if
you
shot
again
it
went
wide
of
the
mark
for
theres
no
other
gunshot
on
him
but
there
are
four
true
knifethrusts
two
above
the
heart
and
two
in
it
who
gave
him
those
i
did
i
said
you
alone
no
one
else
then
the
bear
belongs
to
you
that
is
the
pelt
is
yours
the
flesh
belongs
to
all
but
you
have
the
right
to
divide
it
this
is
the
custom
of
the
west
have
you
anything
to
say
mr
rattler
rattler
growled
something
that
condemned
us
to
a
much
warmer
climate
and
turned
sullenly
to
the
wagon
where
the
liquor
was
stored
i
saw
him
pour
down
glass
after
glass
and
knew
he
would
drink
till
he
could
drink
no
more
the
indians
had
listened
to
our
discussion
and
watched
us
in
silent
interest
but
now
our
affairs
being
settled
the
chief
intschutschuna
turned
to
the
head
engineer
saying
my
ear
has
told
me
that
among
these
palefaces
you
are
chief
is
this
so
yes
bancroft
replied
then
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
what
is
it
you
shall
hear
but
you
are
standing
and
men
should
sit
in
conference
will
you
be
our
guest
asked
bancroft
no
for
it
is
impossible
how
can
i
be
your
guest
when
you
are
on
my
lands
in
my
forests
my
valleys
my
prairies
let
the
white
men
be
seated
tell
me
what
you
wish
of
me
said
bancroft
it
is
not
a
wish
but
a
command
answered
intschutschuna
proudly
we
will
take
no
command
responded
the
head
engineer
with
equal
pride
a
look
of
anger
passed
over
the
chiefs
face
but
he
controlled
himself
and
said
mildly
my
white
brother
will
answer
me
one
question
truthfully
have
you
a
house
yes
with
a
garden
yes
if
a
neighbor
would
cut
a
path
through
that
garden
would
my
brother
submit
to
it
no
the
lands
beyond
the
rocky
mountains
and
east
of
the
mississippi
belong
to
the
palefaces
what
would
they
say
if
the
indians
came
to
build
a
railroad
there
they
would
drive
them
away
my
white
brother
has
answered
truly
but
the
palefaces
come
here
on
these
lands
of
ours
and
drive
away
our
mustangs
and
kill
our
buffaloes
they
seek
among
us
for
gold
and
precious
stones
and
now
they
will
build
a
long
long
road
on
which
their
firehorses
can
run
then
more
palefaces
will
follow
this
road
and
settle
among
us
and
take
the
little
we
have
left
us
what
are
we
to
say
to
this
bancroft
was
silent
have
we
fewer
rights
than
they
you
call
yourselves
christians
and
speak
of
love
yet
you
say
we
can
rob
and
cheat
you
but
you
must
be
honest
with
us
is
that
love
you
say
your
god
is
the
good
father
of
all
men
red
and
white
is
he
only
our
stepfather
and
are
you
his
own
sons
did
not
all
the
land
belong
to
the
red
man
it
has
been
taken
from
us
and
what
have
we
instead
misery
misery
misery
you
drive
us
ever
farther
and
farther
back
and
press
us
closer
and
closer
together
and
in
a
little
time
we
shall
be
suffocated
why
do
you
do
this
is
it
because
you
have
not
room
enough
no
for
there
is
room
in
your
lands
still
for
many
many
millions
each
of
your
tribes
can
have
a
whole
state
but
the
red
man
the
true
owner
may
not
have
a
place
to
lay
his
head
klekipetrah
who
sits
here
before
me
has
taught
me
your
holy
book
there
it
says
that
the
first
man
had
two
sons
and
one
killed
the
other
and
his
blood
cried
to
heaven
how
is
it
with
the
two
brothers
the
red
and
the
white
are
you
not
cain
and
are
we
not
abel
whose
blood
cries
to
heaven
and
when
you
try
to
destroy
us
you
wish
us
to
make
no
defence
but
we
will
defend
ourselves
we
will
defend
ourselves
we
have
been
driven
from
place
to
place
ever
farther
away
now
we
abide
here
where
we
believed
ourselves
at
rest
but
you
come
to
build
your
railroad
have
we
not
the
same
rights
you
have
over
your
house
and
garden
if
we
followed
our
own
laws
we
should
kill
you
but
we
only
wish
your
laws
to
be
fulfilled
towards
us
are
they
no
your
laws
have
two
faces
and
you
turn
them
to
us
as
it
suits
your
advantage
have
you
asked
our
permission
to
build
this
road
no
said
bancroft
it
was
not
necessary
have
you
bought
the
land
or
have
we
sold
it
not
to
me
nor
to
any
other
were
you
an
honest
man
sent
here
to
build
a
way
for
the
firehorse
you
would
first
have
asked
the
man
who
sent
you
whether
he
had
a
right
to
do
this
thing
and
made
him
prove
it
but
this
you
have
not
done
i
forbid
you
to
measure
further
these
last
words
were
spoken
in
a
tone
of
most
bitter
earnest
i
had
read
much
of
the
red
man
but
never
had
found
in
any
book
such
a
speech
from
an
indian
and
i
wondered
if
he
owed
his
fluent
english
and
forcible
logic
to
klekipetrah
the
head
engineer
found
himself
in
an
awkward
predicament
if
he
was
honest
and
sincere
he
could
not
gainsay
what
intschutschuna
had
spoken
but
there
were
considerations
more
weighty
with
bancroft
than
honesty
so
the
chief
had
to
wait
his
answer
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
seeing
that
bancroft
was
shifting
about
in
his
mind
for
a
way
out
of
his
difficulty
intschutschuna
rose
saying
decidedly
there
is
no
need
of
further
speech
i
have
spoken
my
will
is
that
you
leave
here
today
and
go
back
whence
you
came
decide
whether
you
will
obey
or
not
i
will
now
depart
with
my
son
winnetou
and
will
return
at
the
end
of
that
time
which
the
palefaces
call
an
hour
when
you
will
give
me
your
answer
if
you
go
we
are
brothers
if
you
stay
it
shall
be
deadly
enmity
between
you
and
me
i
am
intschutschuna
the
chief
of
all
the
apaches
i
have
spoken
winnetou
followed
him
as
he
went
out
from
among
us
and
they
were
soon
lost
to
sight
down
the
valley
klekipetrah
remained
seated
and
bancroft
turned
to
him
and
asked
his
advice
he
replied
do
as
you
will
sir
i
am
of
the
chiefs
opinion
the
red
race
has
been
cruelly
outraged
and
robbed
but
as
a
white
man
i
know
that
the
indian
must
disappear
if
you
are
an
honest
man
and
go
today
tomorrow
another
will
come
to
carry
on
your
work
i
warn
you
however
that
the
chief
is
in
earnest
he
too
rose
as
if
to
put
an
end
to
further
questioning
i
went
up
to
him
and
said
sir
will
you
let
me
go
with
you
i
promise
to
do
or
say
nothing
that
will
annoy
you
it
is
only
because
i
feel
extraordinary
interest
in
intschutschuna
and
even
more
in
winnetou
that
he
himself
was
included
in
this
interest
i
dared
not
say
yes
come
with
me
a
little
way
he
replied
i
have
withdrawn
from
my
race
and
must
know
them
no
more
but
since
you
have
crossed
my
path
there
can
be
no
harm
in
our
meeting
and
some
good
may
result
from
it
we
will
walk
a
little
together
you
seem
to
me
the
most
intelligent
of
these
men
am
i
right
i
am
the
youngest
and
not
clever
and
i
should
be
honored
if
you
allowed
me
to
go
with
you
i
answered
respectfully
come
then
said
klekipetrah
kindly
and
we
walked
slowly
away
from
the
camp
chapter
vi
a
wish
and
its
tragic
fulfilment
you
do
not
speak
like
a
westerner
said
klekipetrah
as
we
started
no
i
am
from
the
east
i
replied
i
came
here
to
see
the
world
a
bad
thing
to
see
sometimes
i
am
a
german
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
to
find
a
german
become
a
fullfledged
apache
gods
ways
seem
marvellous
but
they
are
natural
after
all
gods
ways
why
do
you
say
god
instead
of
destiny
fate
or
fortune
because
i
am
a
catholic
and
recognize
that
the
hand
of
god
is
in
the
affairs
of
men
you
are
right
and
are
happier
than
you
know
never
lose
that
conviction
yes
it
is
true
that
gods
ways
often
seem
marvellous
but
are
perfectly
natural
the
greatest
marvels
are
the
fulfilment
of
his
laws
and
the
daily
actions
of
nature
are
the
greatest
marvels
a
german
a
student
a
teacher
of
some
renown
and
now
an
apachethese
seem
wonderful
changes
but
they
came
about
naturally
though
he
had
taken
me
with
him
half
unwillingly
he
seemed
glad
to
speak
of
himself
we
had
not
gone
far
from
camp
and
had
lain
down
under
a
tree
where
i
could
study
his
face
and
expression
at
leisure
the
vicissitudes
of
life
had
engraved
deep
lines
upon
his
brow
long
furrows
of
sorrow
the
marks
of
doubt
and
thought
the
many
seams
of
care
and
privation
though
his
eyes
might
once
have
been
piercing
angry
threatening
now
they
were
as
calm
and
clear
as
a
forest
lake
i
should
not
have
dared
to
question
him
as
to
his
evidently
strange
history
though
i
longed
to
know
it
but
he
asked
me
all
about
myself
and
my
answers
were
so
full
and
frank
that
they
gave
him
evident
pleasure
when
he
had
heard
all
there
was
to
learn
of
me
he
bowed
his
head
saying
you
are
at
the
beginning
of
the
conflict
which
i
am
ending
but
you
need
not
fear
you
have
the
good
god
with
you
who
will
never
forsake
you
it
was
otherwise
with
me
i
had
lost
my
god
when
i
left
home
or
rather
was
driven
from
it
and
instead
of
the
staff
of
strong
faith
i
took
with
me
the
worst
companion
a
man
can
havea
bad
conscience
he
looked
at
me
as
he
said
these
words
and
seeing
my
face
unchanged
asked
are
you
not
shocked
nonsense
who
could
suspect
you
of
a
great
crime
i
doubt
your
being
a
thief
or
a
murderer
i
laughed
as
i
spoke
but
he
said
gravely
thank
you
but
you
are
mistaken
i
was
a
thief
for
i
stole
much
that
was
priceless
and
i
was
a
murderer
the
worst
of
murderers
for
i
slew
souls
i
was
a
teacher
in
an
advanced
school
it
does
not
matter
where
i
was
born
a
catholic
but
lost
my
faith
and
my
greatest
pride
lay
in
being
free
and
having
dethroned
god
and
all
my
influence
and
skill
went
to
robbing
others
of
their
faith
i
had
great
power
over
men
and
numberless
were
the
hearers
whom
my
lectures
led
into
infidelity
then
came
the
revolution
he
who
acknowledges
no
god
recognizes
no
king
or
authority
as
sacred
i
placed
myself
at
the
head
of
a
lawless
band
of
malcontents
who
acclaimed
me
as
their
leader
and
we
rose
in
mad
rebellion
against
constituted
authority
how
many
fell
in
that
struggle
i
was
a
murderer
and
the
murderer
not
only
of
these
but
of
others
that
perished
later
behind
prison
walls
i
fled
from
my
fatherland
to
escape
a
like
fate
i
had
no
father
or
mother
no
brother
or
sister
not
a
soul
wept
for
me
but
many
cursed
me
as
the
cause
of
their
sorrow
in
fleeing
from
the
police
i
ran
one
day
through
a
little
garden
and
entered
a
dilapidated
house
where
i
found
an
old
mother
and
her
daughter
in
direst
need
they
told
me
their
pitiful
story
with
bitter
tears
they
had
been
comfortable
the
daughter
married
but
a
year
to
an
honest
man
who
earned
enough
for
a
decent
livelihood
he
had
heard
my
lectures
and
been
led
away
by
them
he
persuaded
his
fatherinlaw
to
join
him
and
take
part
in
the
rebellion
under
my
leadership
the
young
man
fell
on
what
he
thought
a
field
of
honor
but
the
old
father
was
imprisoned
the
women
told
me
this
not
knowing
it
was
their
listener
who
was
responsible
for
their
wretchedness
gods
mills
began
to
grind
freedom
was
mine
still
but
peace
was
gone
i
wandered
everywhere
but
found
no
rest
i
was
often
on
the
verge
of
suicide
but
a
hand
held
me
backgods
hand
at
last
i
reached
the
united
states
and
came
to
the
west
in
kansas
i
met
a
priest
one
of
my
own
countrymen
and
he
saved
me
he
dispelled
my
doubts
and
gave
me
back
faith
and
contentment
dear
lord
i
thank
thee
for
it
he
was
silent
awhile
with
hands
folded
and
gaze
directed
heavenward
then
he
resumed
i
fled
from
the
world
and
men
to
do
penance
and
turned
towards
the
wilderness
i
saw
the
red
mans
wrongs
and
my
heart
overflowed
with
wrath
and
compassion
i
resolved
to
atone
as
far
as
might
be
for
my
wrong
to
the
white
man
by
devotion
to
the
red
i
went
among
the
apaches
learned
their
tongue
and
became
their
teacher
winnetou
is
my
especial
charge
were
he
the
son
of
a
european
lord
he
would
be
a
renowned
prince
for
he
is
richly
endowed
by
nature
would
that
i
might
see
him
a
christian
but
though
i
have
taught
him
all
i
could
of
catholic
truth
it
may
never
be
for
he
shrinks
from
deserting
the
religion
of
his
ancestors
however
it
may
end
i
will
remain
with
him
to
the
day
of
my
death
he
is
my
spiritual
son
i
love
him
more
than
myself
and
it
would
be
joy
to
me
to
receive
in
my
own
heart
a
shot
intended
for
his
for
i
would
gladly
die
for
him
feeling
that
perhaps
such
a
death
might
wash
away
the
last
stain
of
my
sins
his
head
sank
on
his
breast
and
i
remained
silent
feeling
that
anything
i
could
say
would
be
trivial
after
such
a
confession
but
i
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
heartily
he
understood
and
returned
the
pressure
after
a
time
he
spoke
again
why
have
i
told
you
this
i
have
seen
you
today
for
the
first
time
and
probably
we
shall
never
meet
again
has
it
been
by
the
inspiration
of
god
for
i
the
former
blasphemer
now
seek
to
find
his
will
in
all
things
there
is
an
indefinable
feeling
of
melancholy
in
my
heart
which
is
not
exactly
sorrow
it
is
like
the
feeling
that
comes
to
one
when
the
autumn
leaves
are
falling
how
shall
my
tree
of
life
shed
its
leaves
gently
and
after
they
are
sere
or
shall
it
be
cut
down
before
its
natural
time
has
come
he
gazed
in
silence
down
the
valley
where
i
saw
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
returning
they
were
mounted
now
and
leading
klekipetrahs
horse
we
rose
to
go
to
the
camp
which
we
reached
as
the
indians
came
up
rattler
leaned
against
the
wagon
his
face
on
fire
for
in
the
short
time
that
had
passed
he
had
drunk
as
much
as
he
possibly
could
and
was
a
horrible
sight
his
eyes
were
like
a
wild
beasts
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
watch
him
for
he
was
dangerous
the
chief
and
winnetou
dismounted
and
came
towards
us
have
my
white
brothers
decided
to
go
or
stay
asked
intschutschuna
the
head
engineer
had
thought
of
a
compromise
and
said
we
must
stay
here
whether
we
would
or
not
and
obey
the
command
laid
upon
us
but
we
will
send
to
santa
f
and
ask
for
instructions
from
those
that
sent
us
and
then
we
will
answer
this
was
a
cunning
thought
for
by
that
time
our
work
would
be
done
but
the
chief
said
decidedly
i
will
not
wait
my
white
brother
must
say
at
once
what
he
will
do
rattler
had
filled
a
glass
with
whisky
and
came
towards
the
two
indians
saying
incoherently
if
the
indians
will
drink
with
me
we
will
go
if
not
we
wont
let
the
young
one
drink
first
heres
firewater
winnetou
he
held
out
the
glass
winnetou
stepped
back
in
disgust
what
you
wont
drink
with
me
thats
an
insult
here
take
the
whisky
you
red
dog
lick
it
up
if
you
wont
drink
it
before
any
one
could
stop
him
he
had
thrown
the
contents
of
the
glass
in
the
young
apaches
face
according
to
indian
custom
such
an
insult
was
to
be
avenged
by
death
but
winnetou
merely
struck
him
to
the
earth
while
like
his
fathers
his
face
betrayed
no
sign
of
what
he
felt
and
the
drunkard
picked
himself
up
and
staggered
back
to
the
wagon
once
more
said
intschutschuna
and
this
is
the
last
time
i
ask
will
the
palefaces
leave
our
valley
today
we
cannot
was
the
reply
then
remember
there
is
strife
between
us
i
started
towards
them
but
the
three
strangers
turned
back
to
their
horses
without
noticing
me
from
the
wagon
came
rattlers
voice
crying
get
out
you
red
coyotes
but
the
young
one
shall
pay
for
knocking
me
down
quicker
than
it
can
be
told
he
had
snatched
a
gun
from
the
wagon
and
aimed
it
at
winnetou
who
was
standing
alone
without
protection
where
the
bullet
must
have
found
him
nor
was
there
time
to
warn
him
klekipetrah
cried
in
anguish
down
winnetou
down
at
the
same
time
springing
before
the
young
apache
the
shot
whistled
through
the
air
klekipetrah
fell
to
the
ground
with
one
hand
at
his
breast
while
at
the
same
moment
rattler
fell
struck
by
my
hand
i
had
sprung
at
him
as
soon
as
i
saw
his
intention
but
too
late
a
cry
of
horror
arose
from
all
sides
only
the
two
apaches
were
silent
they
knelt
by
the
friend
who
had
given
his
life
for
them
and
examined
his
wound
it
was
close
to
the
heart
and
the
blood
flowed
from
it
in
torrents
i
too
knelt
by
klekipetrah
whose
eyes
were
closed
and
whose
face
was
fast
growing
white
and
drawn
lay
his
head
on
your
breast
i
said
to
winnetou
if
he
sees
you
when
he
opens
his
eyes
his
death
will
be
happier
without
a
word
winnetou
followed
my
suggestion
and
his
eyes
never
wandered
from
the
dying
man
at
last
he
opened
his
eyes
and
seeing
winnetou
bending
over
him
a
peaceful
smile
came
over
his
suffering
face
and
he
whispered
winnetou
o
my
son
winnetou
then
his
failing
eyes
seemed
to
seek
something
till
he
saw
me
and
he
said
to
me
in
german
stay
with
him
be
true
to
him
carry
on
my
work
he
raised
his
hand
imploringly
i
took
it
and
replied
i
will
i
promise
you
i
will
an
ineffable
expression
came
upon
his
face
and
he
murmured
in
a
faint
voice
my
leaves
are
cut
off

he
folded
his
hands
a
flood
of
blood
burst
from
his
wound
his
head
fell
back
he
was
dead
now
i
knew
what
had
led
him
to
unburden
his
heart
to
methe
inspiration
of
god
as
he
had
said
he
had
wished
to
die
for
winnetou
how
quickly
had
his
wish
been
fulfilled
the
last
trace
of
his
sin
had
been
washed
away
god
is
love
and
infinite
compassion
the
contrite
he
will
in
no
wise
cast
out
winnetou
laid
the
dead
mans
head
in
the
grass
slowly
rose
and
looked
interrogatively
at
his
father
there
lies
the
murderer
where
i
have
struck
him
down
he
is
yours
i
said
firewater
only
this
brief
reply
came
from
the
chiefs
lips
in
contemptuous
tones
i
will
be
your
friend
your
brother
i
will
go
with
you
the
words
burst
from
me
involuntarily
intschutschuna
spat
in
my
face
miserable
cur
he
said
thief
of
our
land
dare
to
follow
us
and
i
will
crush
you
i
let
the
insult
pass
awed
by
the
presence
of
the
dead
and
my
promise
to
him
the
white
men
stood
dumbly
waiting
to
see
what
the
apaches
would
do
they
never
glanced
at
us
again
placing
the
corpse
on
the
horse
which
klekipetrah
had
ridden
they
bound
it
fast
took
the
bridle
and
mounting
themselves
rode
away
they
spoke
no
word
and
as
sam
hawkins
watched
them
disappear
he
said
that
is
more
dangerous
than
the
most
dreadful
threats
we
shall
see
trouble
and
there
lies
the
cause
with
no
mind
or
soul
what
shall
we
do
with
him
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
answer
i
saddled
my
horse
and
rode
away
i
wished
to
be
alone
to
escape
hearing
this
last
awful
halfhour
discussed
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
weary
and
exhausted
in
body
and
soul
i
returned
to
the
camp
chapter
vii
a
compact
with
the
kiowas
it
was
decided
by
our
party
that
we
were
not
able
under
the
circumstances
to
punish
rattler
for
his
crime
which
was
most
unsatisfactory
to
my
youthful
sense
of
justice
sam
pointed
out
however
that
his
punishment
was
swift
and
certain
at
the
hands
of
the
apaches
but
the
drawback
to
this
consolation
was
that
we
who
were
innocent
were
likely
to
suffer
with
the
guilty
we
knew
that
the
indians
would
return
to
avenge
klekipetrahs
murder
as
soon
as
they
could
summon
their
warriors
and
the
most
important
thing
for
us
was
to
discover
where
the
main
body
of
the
braves
were
how
far
the
chief
and
his
son
must
ride
to
come
up
with
them
and
consequently
when
we
could
expect
their
return
bancroft
was
most
anxious
to
finish
our
work
before
we
left
provided
there
was
time
before
the
anticipated
attack
and
calculated
that
it
would
require
five
days
to
complete
our
task
so
sam
hawkins
volunteered
to
ride
on
the
trail
of
the
chiefs
who
had
visited
us
to
discover
if
possible
all
that
we
needed
to
know
and
took
me
with
him
partly
for
protection
because
i
had
earned
such
a
reputation
for
being
able
to
strike
a
hard
blow
with
what
sam
called
my
lily
ladyfingers
partly
that
i
might
have
experience
in
the
art
of
following
a
trail
and
partly
i
hope
because
he
liked
to
have
me
with
him
i
had
not
been
able
to
eat
or
sleep
the
night
after
the
murder
for
i
could
not
cease
going
over
the
dreadful
scene
i
saw
myself
seated
by
klekipetrah
heard
his
story
which
had
become
to
me
a
dying
confession
and
thought
again
and
again
of
his
last
words
expressing
a
presentiment
of
his
coming
death
yes
the
tree
of
his
life
had
not
fallen
naturally
but
had
been
violently
cut
down
and
by
what
an
assassin
for
what
a
reason
and
in
what
a
manner
if
there
was
any
consolation
to
be
found
in
the
bloody
work
of
that
day
it
was
that
klekipetrah
had
died
on
winnetous
heart
and
he
had
received
the
shot
intended
for
his
beloved
pupil
but
what
of
his
request
that
i
should
cling
to
winnetou
and
fulfil
the
work
that
he
had
begun
only
a
few
moments
before
he
had
said
that
we
should
probably
never
meet
again
and
indeed
my
path
in
life
lay
far
enough
from
the
apaches
and
yet
he
had
left
me
a
problem
the
solution
of
which
would
bring
me
into
the
most
intimate
relations
with
that
tribe
was
this
request
but
chance
words
or
was
the
dying
man
in
the
last
moment
of
his
life
as
his
soul
fluttered
on
the
border
of
the
next
world
given
a
glimpse
of
the
future
it
seems
so
for
events
enabled
me
to
fulfil
his
wish
though
then
it
appeared
extremely
unlikely
that
i
should
ever
be
brought
into
friendly
contact
with
winnetou
but
why
above
all
had
i
so
quickly
given
my
pledge
to
the
dying
man
through
pity
yes
undoubtedly
but
there
was
another
reason
winnetou
had
made
an
impression
upon
me
such
as
i
had
never
received
from
any
other
man
he
was
exactly
my
age
yet
of
far
greater
parts
and
this
i
felt
from
the
first
glance
at
him
the
proud
earnestness
of
his
clear
velvety
eyes
the
quiet
certainty
of
his
bearing
and
the
profound
sorrow
on
his
fine
young
face
had
revealed
it
to
me
how
admirable
had
been
his
conduct
and
that
of
his
father
and
what
a
lesson
for
many
a
white
man
lay
in
intschutschunas
one
word
of
explanation
of
rattlers
crime
firewater
these
thoughts
and
the
dread
of
meeting
as
enemies
returned
to
slay
me
and
my
comrades
these
two
whom
i
not
only
liked
but
whom
i
had
promised
to
befriend
kept
all
sleep
from
my
eyelids
and
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
i
set
out
with
sam
on
the
following
morning
to
ride
on
their
trail
we
started
early
before
the
sun
had
risen
it
was
my
very
first
scouting
expedition
and
though
i
have
since
taken
many
such
rides
i
can
never
forget
this
first
one
the
trail
was
easily
followed
a
fact
which
made
sam
doubt
its
being
trustworthy
for
he
said
that
when
an
indian
left
his
course
so
easily
traced
by
an
enemy
the
chance
was
it
was
done
only
to
lead
that
enemy
into
a
trap
but
i
felt
sure
that
in
this
case
it
was
only
because
the
chief
and
winnetou
were
too
heavily
encumbered
by
the
corpse
of
klekipetrah
and
in
too
great
haste
to
avenge
his
murder
to
obliterate
the
trace
of
their
course
and
rode
on
with
no
fear
of
an
ambush
it
was
an
hour
before
midday
when
we
came
to
a
thicket
of
young
oaks
where
the
indians
had
evidently
halted
to
cut
saplings
for
a
litter
or
drag
for
the
body
of
klekipetrah
for
we
saw
the
leaves
and
twigs
which
they
had
stripped
from
the
young
trees
in
its
construction
lying
on
the
ground
here
sam
reined
up
saying
now
weve
gone
far
enough
well
rest
awhile
winnetou
rode
all
night
to
this
point
do
you
see
that
the
trail
goes
on
from
here
in
single
file
that
means
that
they
rode
this
way
to
cover
the
fact
that
one
has
gone
on
alone
for
greater
speed
leaving
the
other
to
follow
with
the
body
the
one
in
advance
is
probably
the
chief
and
winnetou
has
taken
charge
of
his
murdered
teacher
this
will
enable
intschutschuna
to
summon
his
braves
quickly
and
we
may
expect
their
return
very
soon
perhaps
before
the
five
days
are
up
which
you
need
for
your
work
we
let
our
horses
or
rather
my
horse
and
nancy
drink
at
a
stream
which
flowed
between
the
saplings
and
we
lay
down
to
rest
for
half
an
hour
before
we
turned
to
go
back
we
lay
silent
i
thinking
of
the
approaching
struggle
with
the
apaches
while
i
saw
by
the
regular
heaving
of
his
breast
that
sam
slept
if
i
needed
a
proof
of
the
intelligence
of
animals
and
the
keenness
attained
by
the
senses
of
both
man
and
beast
in
a
life
in
the
wilds
i
was
to
receive
it
now
the
mule
was
tethered
in
the
bushes
where
she
could
see
nothing
nibbling
the
leaves
and
grass
she
was
not
a
sociable
beast
and
preferred
to
be
alone
while
my
horse
grazed
close
to
my
elbow
suddenly
nancy
uttered
a
short
sharp
i
might
almost
say
warning
note
and
in
an
instant
sam
was
awake
and
on
his
feet
i
was
asleep
but
nancy
woke
me
some
man
or
beast
is
coming
where
is
my
mule
he
cried
here
in
the
bushes
this
way
we
crawled
through
the
undergrowth
and
saw
only
nancy
looking
out
through
the
branches
her
long
ears
waved
excitedly
and
her
tail
swung
from
side
to
side
but
when
she
saw
us
coming
she
quieted
down
ears
and
tail
were
still
we
peered
out
and
saw
six
indians
coming
on
the
trail
single
file
the
first
one
a
short
but
muscular
man
kept
his
head
down
apparently
never
raising
his
eyes
from
the
trail
they
all
wore
leather
leggings
and
dark
woollen
shirts
and
were
armed
with
muskets
knives
and
tomahawks
their
faces
shone
with
grease
and
across
each
one
ran
a
red
and
a
blue
stripe
what
a
lucky
meeting
they
are
kiowas
and
theyll
save
us
said
sam
the
one
ahead
is
bao
which
means
fox
a
daring
and
crafty
warrior
as
his
name
indicates
the
chief
of
the
band
is
called
tangua
a
bold
indian
and
a
good
friend
of
mine
they
have
their
warpaint
on
and
apparently
they
also
are
reconnoitering
the
six
warriors
drew
near
while
i
was
wondering
how
they
could
save
us
six
indians
would
not
be
much
help
but
it
was
a
comfort
to
find
that
sam
knew
them
and
that
at
least
we
had
nothing
to
fear
from
them
sam
stepped
forth
from
the
bushes
put
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
uttered
a
peculiar
sharp
cry
which
they
seemed
to
recognize
for
they
reined
in
their
horses
and
shouted
back
again
sam
called
to
them
and
signalled
and
they
understood
both
cry
and
signal
for
returning
them
they
galloped
toward
us
is
our
white
brother
sam
here
asked
the
leader
as
he
came
up
how
comes
he
in
the
path
of
his
red
friend
and
brother
bao
the
crafty
fox
has
met
me
because
he
came
upon
my
tracks
answered
sam
we
thought
they
were
the
tracks
of
the
red
dogs
we
seek
said
the
fox
in
broken
but
perfectly
comprehensible
english
what
does
my
brother
mean
the
apaches
of
the
tribe
of
mascaleros
why
do
you
call
them
dogs
is
there
enmity
between
them
and
the
brave
kiowas
there
is
war
between
us
and
these
scurvy
coyotes
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
my
brothers
may
sit
down
with
us
for
i
have
something
important
to
tell
them
the
fox
looked
at
me
searchingly
and
said
i
have
never
seen
this
young
paleface
is
he
one
of
the
warriors
of
the
white
men
has
he
won
a
name
if
sam
had
told
him
my
own
name
it
would
have
made
no
impression
so
he
fell
back
on
the
name
wheeler
had
given
me
this
is
my
dearest
friend
and
brother
and
though
he
is
young
he
is
a
great
warrior
among
his
own
people
in
the
rising
sun
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
a
buffalo
yet
two
days
ago
he
fought
with
two
bulls
to
save
my
life
and
killed
them
and
yesterday
he
stabbed
a
grizzly
bear
of
the
rockies
with
his
knife
and
received
no
scratch
himself
ugh
ugh
grunted
the
indians
regarding
me
approvingly
his
bullet
never
misses
its
mark
and
in
his
hand
dwells
such
strength
that
at
a
blow
from
him
his
enemy
falls
to
the
ground
therefore
the
white
men
of
the
west
call
him
old
shatterhand
thus
without
any
choice
of
mine
i
was
given
the
name
which
has
ever
since
clung
to
me
the
fox
offered
me
his
hand
and
said
in
friendly
tones
if
old
shatterhand
will
we
will
be
friends
and
brothers
we
love
men
who
can
knock
down
an
enemy
with
a
blow
and
he
shall
be
welcome
among
us
which
really
meant
we
need
allies
with
such
strength
so
come
to
us
however
i
replied
i
love
the
red
men
for
they
are
the
sons
of
the
great
spirit
whose
children
we
also
are
we
are
brothers
and
will
unite
against
all
enemies
who
do
not
respect
us
a
smirk
of
satisfaction
passed
over
his
greased
and
painted
face
as
he
replied
old
shatterhand
has
spoken
well
we
will
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
with
him
so
saying
he
seated
himself
and
brought
out
a
pipe
which
he
filled
with
a
mixture
apparently
of
red
turnip
hemp
chopped
acorns
and
sour
sorrel
lighted
it
rose
took
a
whiff
puffed
it
towards
heaven
and
earth
and
said
above
dwells
the
great
spirit
and
here
on
earth
exist
the
plants
and
beasts
which
he
made
for
the
kiowa
warriors
then
he
took
another
whiff
and
blew
it
towards
the
north
east
south
and
west
saying
in
all
directions
dwell
the
red
and
white
men
who
wrongfully
take
these
beasts
and
plants
for
themselves
but
we
shall
find
them
and
take
what
is
ours
i
have
spoken
how
what
a
speech
this
kiowa
openly
declared
his
tribe
the
owner
of
everything
and
hence
robbery
was
not
only
his
right
but
his
duty
and
i
must
treat
this
sort
of
people
as
friends
the
fox
handed
the
pipe
to
sam
who
took
half
a
dozen
puffs
and
said
the
great
spirit
judges
not
the
appearance
of
men
nor
can
they
deceive
him
by
painting
their
faces
for
he
sees
the
heart
the
hearts
of
the
warriors
of
the
glorious
tribe
of
the
kiowas
are
brave
and
wise
mine
is
bound
to
them
as
my
mule
is
tied
to
the
tree
and
will
be
so
forever
i
have
spoken
how
that
was
just
like
sam
the
artful
jolly
little
man
who
always
knew
how
to
win
his
hearers
and
yet
have
his
joke
and
now
it
was
my
turn
to
take
the
foul
pipe
and
become
eloquent
i
also
rose
took
a
whiff
andyes
the
turnip
hemp
acorns
sour
sorrel
were
all
there
in
the
pipebowl
but
there
seemed
to
be
a
fifth
ingredient
in
the
mixture
for
it
tasted
as
if
it
had
bits
of
felt
shoes
in
it
i
puffed
the
smoke
towards
the
earth
and
the
sky
and
said
the
sunshine
and
air
come
from
heaven
whence
come
all
good
gifts
the
earth
receives
the
warmth
and
moisture
and
gives
them
to
the
buffalo
and
mustang
and
bear
and
deer
to
the
pumpkin
and
corn
and
all
good
plants
from
which
the
red
man
makes
his
kinnikinnic
that
in
the
pipe
of
peace
breathes
brotherly
love
i
had
read
that
indians
call
their
tobacco
kinnikinnic
and
the
knowledge
opportunely
came
back
to
me
now
a
second
time
i
filled
my
mouth
with
smoke
and
blew
it
toward
heaven
and
continued
in
the
west
rise
the
rocky
mountains
and
to
the
east
stretch
the
plains
on
the
north
roll
the
seas
and
the
south
is
washed
by
the
waters
of
the
great
ocean
were
all
the
land
between
these
points
mine
i
would
share
it
with
the
warriors
of
the
kiowas
for
they
are
my
brothers
this
year
may
they
kill
ten
times
as
many
buffaloes
and
fifty
times
as
many
grizzly
bears
as
they
number
may
their
corn
grow
as
large
as
pumpkins
and
their
pumpkins
so
great
that
twenty
could
be
made
from
one
i
have
spoken
how
these
wishes
were
not
very
practical
but
they
seemed
to
please
the
indians
as
much
as
if
they
were
already
fulfilled
the
fox
seized
my
hand
assured
me
of
his
friendship
for
all
time
then
took
the
pipe
between
his
teeth
and
smoked
in
supreme
content
having
brought
the
indians
into
a
state
of
high
good
humor
sam
said
my
brothers
say
that
the
warhatchet
has
been
dug
up
between
them
and
the
apaches
of
the
mascaleros
how
long
has
this
been
so
and
what
has
ended
the
peace
between
them
since
the
time
two
weeks
ago
when
the
apache
dogs
killed
four
of
our
warriors
where
at
rio
pecos
that
is
not
your
camp
but
that
of
the
mascaleros
what
were
your
warriors
doing
there
the
kiowa
did
not
hesitate
to
reply
candidly
a
band
of
our
braves
went
at
night
to
capture
some
of
the
apaches
horses
the
vile
dogs
watch
well
they
killed
our
brave
men
therefore
we
have
taken
up
the
warhatchet
so
the
kiowas
had
intended
to
steal
yet
would
make
the
apaches
atone
for
their
defence
of
their
own
property
i
would
have
expressed
my
mind
on
this
conduct
but
sam
signalled
to
me
so
energetically
to
be
quiet
that
i
obeyed
him
and
he
said
my
brother
the
fox
is
out
to
spy
when
will
his
braves
follow
they
are
one
day
behind
us
who
leads
them
tangua
the
chief
himself
at
the
head
of
two
hundred
braves
and
you
expect
to
overcome
the
apaches
we
will
come
upon
them
as
the
eagle
swoops
on
the
heron
that
has
not
seen
him
my
brother
is
mistaken
the
apaches
know
that
they
are
to
be
attacked
by
the
kiowas
the
fox
shook
his
head
incredulously
and
replied
how
could
they
know
it
do
their
ears
reach
to
the
tent
of
the
kiowas
yes
i
do
not
understand
my
brother
sam
he
must
tell
me
what
he
means
the
apaches
have
ears
which
can
walk
and
ride
yesterday
we
saw
two
such
ears
that
had
been
listening
at
the
camp
of
the
kiowas
uff
two
ears
two
scouts
yes
my
brothers
have
not
considered
everything
intschutschuna
the
chief
of
the
apaches
is
a
very
wise
warrior
when
he
saw
that
his
people
had
killed
four
kiowas
he
said
to
himself
that
the
kiowas
would
be
avenged
and
set
out
to
spy
upon
you
uff
uff
he
himself
yes
and
his
son
winnetou
uff
he
too
had
we
known
that
we
would
have
captured
the
two
dogs
i
must
hasten
back
to
tell
this
to
the
chief
that
he
may
call
out
more
braves
we
are
enough
for
a
surprise
but
not
if
we
are
expected
will
sam
and
old
shatterhand
ride
with
me
yes
not
to
tangua
the
chief
of
the
kiowas
but
to
our
camp
that
i
cannot
do
hear
what
i
say
would
you
take
intschutschuna
the
chief
of
the
apaches
a
prisoner
alive
uff
cried
the
kiowa
as
if
electrified
and
his
voice
was
earsplitting
then
he
said
if
my
brother
has
a
jest
on
his
tongue
i
will
not
bear
it
nonsense
i
am
in
earnest
in
five
or
six
days
at
most
and
i
cant
tell
how
much
sooner
you
can
capture
the
chief
and
his
son
winnetou
alive
where
in
our
camp
and
youll
see
how
if
you
listen
to
what
i
tell
you
sam
then
told
the
indian
of
our
road
to
which
they
had
no
objection
and
of
our
meeting
with
the
apaches
as
he
ended
he
said
i
wondered
to
see
the
two
chiefs
alone
and
decided
they
were
buffalohunting
and
had
parted
from
their
followers
for
a
little
time
but
now
i
see
it
all
they
were
out
reconnoitring
and
the
fact
that
the
two
heads
of
the
tribe
made
this
ride
themselves
shows
they
considered
it
an
important
matter
now
they
will
thirst
for
a
double
vengeance
on
you
and
on
us
for
klekipetrahs
murder
they
will
send
a
smaller
band
against
us
than
against
you
and
the
chief
and
his
son
will
be
with
the
former
after
we
have
shown
you
our
camp
that
you
may
find
it
again
you
will
go
back
to
your
chief
tell
him
all
i
have
said
and
he
will
come
with
his
two
hundred
braves
to
wait
for
intschutschuna
with
his
little
band
we
are
twenty
strong
and
of
course
will
help
you
and
it
will
be
childs
play
to
capture
the
apaches
it
is
like
having
the
whole
tribe
to
have
the
chiefs
for
you
can
demand
of
them
what
you
will
does
my
brother
see
it
all
yes
my
white
brothers
plan
is
very
good
and
we
will
start
at
once
to
reach
his
camp
before
dark
we
mounted
and
galloped
towards
the
camp
cutting
across
by
a
shorter
route
since
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
follow
the
trail
i
was
shocked
at
sam
hawkins
and
very
angry
with
him
winnetou
the
noble
winnetou
and
his
father
were
to
be
betrayed
into
a
trap
which
if
successful
would
destroy
them
how
could
hawkins
have
formed
such
a
scheme
i
tried
in
vain
to
get
him
apart
from
the
kiowas
to
ask
an
explanation
but
he
seemed
to
suspect
my
intention
and
stuck
close
to
the
fox
which
made
me
angrier
than
ever
when
we
got
into
camp
i
sprang
from
my
horse
and
lay
down
on
the
grass
in
no
very
happy
frame
of
mind
disregarding
all
my
signals
to
him
sam
had
taken
the
indians
to
our
men
who
were
in
a
high
state
of
delight
when
they
learned
they
had
come
in
friendship
and
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
for
our
fearing
the
apaches
after
the
kiowas
had
been
hospitably
received
and
entertained
sam
came
to
me
for
the
first
time
you
have
a
long
face
tonight
he
said
is
it
real
indigestion
or
mental
colic
i
suspect
its
the
latter
open
your
heart
to
me
and
ill
cure
you
id
be
glad
if
you
could
sam
but
i
doubt
it
yes
i
can
only
try
me
tell
me
then
how
winnetou
struck
you
as
a
fine
fellow
just
as
he
did
you
yet
you
will
betray
him
to
his
death
how
does
that
hang
together
to
his
death
i
thats
impossible
for
my
fathers
son
but
youll
make
him
a
prisoner
of
these
villains
and
that
means
death
dont
believe
that
fairy
tale
on
the
contrary
id
do
a
good
deal
to
save
winnetou
if
he
were
in
danger
then
why
do
you
set
this
trap
and
listen
sam
if
he
is
captured
ill
free
him
and
if
a
weapon
is
turned
on
him
ill
stand
by
his
side
and
fight
for
him
i
warn
you
of
this
frankly
i
promised
a
dying
man
to
be
his
friend
and
that
is
as
binding
to
me
as
an
oath
i
like
that
i
like
that
sam
announced
we
agree
there
oh
yes
i
exclaimed
impatiently
you
say
so
but
how
do
your
good
words
agree
with
your
actions
so
that
is
what
you
want
to
know
hey
old
sam
hawkins
suspected
you
wanted
to
speak
to
him
but
he
dared
not
let
you
hes
a
different
fellow
than
he
seems
only
hes
not
going
to
show
his
cards
to
any
one
but
you
and
dick
stone
and
will
parker
who
are
to
help
in
his
plot
we
were
lucky
to
have
met
the
kiowas
and
learned
all
we
know
now
and
i
really
dont
see
any
other
way
of
saving
ourselves
from
the
apaches
however
much
you
may
admire
winnetou
youd
have
to
love
him
in
eternity
for
being
ignorant
of
your
devotion
to
him
hed
send
you
there
in
short
order
now
the
kiowas
will
come
here
with
their
two
hundred
braves
ill
warn
winnetou
i
interrupted
heaven
forbid
cried
sam
that
would
only
ruin
us
for
the
apaches
would
put
an
end
to
us
and
the
kiowas
together
no
they
must
actually
be
face
to
face
with
death
and
if
then
we
secretly
free
them
as
we
will
theyll
be
grateful
and
forego
all
revenge
on
us
at
most
theyll
only
demand
rattler
of
us
and
i
would
not
object
to
that
what
do
you
say
now
my
angry
gentleman
i
gave
him
my
hand
and
replied
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
my
dear
sam
youve
thought
it
all
out
well
havent
i
hawkins
has
his
good
side
after
all
are
we
friends
again
yes
old
sam
and
im
sorry
i
was
so
suspicious
then
put
your
head
down
and
sleep
for
tomorrow
theres
a
good
deal
to
do
ill
go
now
and
look
up
stone
and
parker
to
let
them
know
where
we
stand
good
night
and
trust
me
better
next
time
wasnt
he
a
kind
trusty
fellow
this
queer
old
sam
hawkins
chapter
viii
sam
hawkins
goes
spying
when
sam
left
me
i
tried
to
sleep
but
it
was
long
before
i
succeeded
the
camp
was
noisy
over
the
coming
of
the
kiowas
and
our
rescue
thereby
and
besides
my
own
thoughts
were
not
soothing
hawkins
had
spoken
of
his
plans
confidently
as
though
they
could
not
miscarry
but
after
i
was
left
alone
i
was
not
so
sure
of
them
we
were
to
free
winnetou
and
his
father
but
nothing
had
been
said
of
the
other
apaches
would
they
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
kiowas
when
their
chiefs
were
rescued
we
four
men
could
scarcely
liberate
all
the
apaches
especially
as
it
was
to
be
done
so
secretly
that
no
suspicion
could
fall
on
us
and
how
were
the
apaches
to
come
into
the
hands
of
the
kiowas
hardly
without
a
struggle
and
it
was
easy
to
foresee
that
these
very
two
whom
we
wished
to
deliver
would
defend
themselves
most
bravely
and
hence
be
in
the
greatest
danger
of
death
how
could
we
prevent
this
i
thought
long
over
these
problems
twisting
myself
into
every
imaginable
position
but
could
find
no
way
out
of
the
difficulty
the
only
thought
which
comforted
me
in
a
measure
was
that
clever
trusty
little
sam
would
find
a
way
out
and
as
to
myself
i
determined
to
stand
by
the
chiefs
and
if
necessary
defend
them
with
my
life
so
at
last
i
went
to
sleep
the
next
morning
i
went
at
my
work
with
redoubled
energy
to
make
up
for
the
previous
days
absence
each
man
did
his
best
so
we
went
forward
far
more
rapidly
than
usual
and
by
night
had
doubled
the
amount
of
work
done
the
day
before
of
course
moving
the
camp
onward
as
we
worked
we
were
equally
industrious
on
the
next
day
till
noon
when
an
interruption
came
in
the
shape
of
the
kiowas
these
indians
arrived
just
as
the
sun
was
highest
they
were
of
strong
fighting
build
all
armed
with
guns
tomahawks
and
knives
their
leader
was
of
truly
imposing
size
with
a
sharp
sinister
face
and
a
pair
of
knavish
eyes
that
spoke
no
good
of
their
owner
when
i
saw
his
face
i
thought
it
would
go
hard
with
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
if
they
fell
into
his
hands
he
was
called
tangua
a
word
meaning
chief
though
he
was
there
as
our
friend
and
ally
he
treated
us
in
a
manner
far
from
friendly
but
came
like
a
tiger
that
had
joined
a
leopard
after
prey
and
would
rend
his
ally
the
next
moment
as
the
chief
came
up
he
did
not
dismount
to
greet
us
but
made
a
comprehensive
salute
with
his
hand
including
us
all
and
rode
straight
to
our
wagon
and
lifted
the
cover
to
look
in
its
contents
seemed
to
please
him
for
he
dismounted
and
got
into
the
wagon
to
examine
them
oho
cried
sam
hawkins
standing
beside
me
he
appears
to
want
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
our
property
before
he
says
a
word
if
he
thinks
sam
hawkins
is
stupid
enough
to
stand
like
a
hitchingpost
he
makes
a
mistake
as
ill
show
him
pretty
quick
no
rashness
sam
i
begged
these
two
hundred
fellows
are
too
much
for
us
in
numbers
yes
in
wit
no
he
answered
it
looks
as
though
we
had
taken
pretty
poor
accomplices
but
come
over
to
the
wagon
and
hearken
how
sam
hawkins
talks
to
such
rascals
im
well
acquainted
with
this
tangua
and
if
he
doesnt
know
im
here
hell
have
to
find
it
out
come
on
we
had
our
guns
in
our
hands
and
proceeded
to
the
wagon
where
tangua
was
rummaging
sam
asked
in
a
warning
tone
does
the
glorious
chief
of
the
kiowas
wish
to
go
instantly
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
the
indian
whose
back
was
toward
us
stooping
over
straightened
himself
turned
to
us
and
answered
gruffly
why
does
the
paleface
interrupt
me
with
this
silly
question
tangua
will
rule
as
a
great
chief
in
the
happy
hunting
grounds
in
the
end
but
a
long
time
must
pass
before
he
journeys
there
that
time
may
come
in
one
minute
why
get
out
of
the
wagon
and
ill
tell
you
only
be
quick
about
it
i
will
stay
here
good
then
go
up
in
a
burst
said
sam
turning
as
if
to
go
away
the
chief
sprang
from
the
wagon
seized
sams
arm
and
cried
go
up
in
a
burst
why
does
sam
hawkins
speak
such
words
to
warn
you
of
death
which
would
have
grabbed
you
in
a
moment
if
you
stayed
there
uff
is
death
in
that
wagon
show
him
to
me
later
maybe
have
not
your
spies
told
you
why
we
are
here
i
learned
from
them
that
you
wish
to
make
a
road
for
the
firehorse
of
the
palefaces
thats
it
and
such
a
road
goes
over
rivers
under
ground
and
through
rocks
you
know
that
and
you
may
have
heard
of
the
stuff
with
which
we
blow
up
the
mighty
rocks
which
are
in
the
way
of
our
firehorses
feet
is
it
that
powder
with
which
we
load
our
guns
no
the
palefaces
have
made
another
discovery
by
which
they
can
overthrow
whole
mountains
right
and
this
discovery
we
carry
in
that
wagon
done
up
in
packages
and
if
you
touch
it
carelessly
it
will
explode
in
your
hands
and
blow
you
into
a
thousand
pieces
uff
uff
he
grunted
evidently
shocked
was
i
near
one
of
these
packages
so
near
that
if
you
had
not
sprung
down
you
would
be
this
moment
in
the
happy
hunting
grounds
and
what
would
you
have
had
with
you
no
medicine
no
scalplock
nothing
nothing
at
all
but
little
bits
of
flesh
and
bones
how
could
you
rule
as
a
great
chief
in
the
happy
hunting
grounds
in
such
a
state
you
would
have
been
crushed
under
foot
by
the
spirithorses
an
indian
who
comes
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
without
medicine
or
scalplocks
will
be
received
by
the
dead
heroes
with
contempt
and
have
to
hide
from
their
eyes
while
they
drink
deep
of
all
indian
joys
this
is
the
belief
of
the
red
man
what
a
misfortune
then
to
arrive
shattered
into
little
bits
one
could
see
under
the
dark
skin
that
the
shock
had
driven
the
blood
from
the
chiefs
face
and
he
cried
ugh
how
good
that
you
warned
me
in
time
because
we
are
friends
and
brothers
said
sam
i
will
go
and
warn
my
braves
lest
they
go
near
that
dangerous
wagon
and
suffer
death
said
tangua
do
so
i
pray
you
for
not
only
they
but
you
and
i
and
all
here
would
be
blown
up
with
them
if
one
who
does
not
understand
how
to
use
this
discovery
were
to
touch
it
he
would
blow
up
his
friends
as
well
as
his
enemies
while
in
our
hands
it
is
sure
to
blow
up
those
whom
we
choose
to
dispose
of
let
us
warn
your
braves
and
at
the
same
time
remind
them
that
they
have
not
yet
greeted
their
white
brothers
with
this
happy
hint
of
the
possible
consequences
of
offending
us
and
reminder
of
his
omission
coupled
with
a
sly
wink
at
me
sam
accompanied
the
chief
to
his
braves
the
kiowas
and
our
three
scouts
held
a
conference
to
discuss
the
best
means
for
carrying
out
the
capture
of
the
apaches
while
we
surveyors
continued
working
until
darkness
forced
us
to
discontinue
we
seated
ourselves
all
together
around
the
fire
after
supper
and
the
camp
presented
to
me
unused
to
such
a
scene
a
picture
of
the
greatest
interest
sam
hawkins
and
his
two
inseparable
companions
sat
near
me
around
the
blazing
fire
were
the
redskins
their
greased
faces
shining
in
its
light
while
just
beyond
the
horses
were
grazing
and
dimly
seen
in
the
distance
were
the
sentinels
which
the
chief
had
stationed
there
as
i
looked
from
one
coppercolored
face
to
another
i
saw
none
which
i
would
have
trusted
to
show
compassion
to
an
enemy
i
asked
sam
the
result
of
the
conference
you
may
be
satisfied
he
said
nothing
will
happen
to
your
two
darlings
but
if
they
should
try
to
defend
themselves
it
will
never
come
to
that
they
will
be
overcome
before
they
have
a
chance
to
know
what
has
happened
we
know
which
way
they
are
coming
do
you
theyll
go
to
the
spot
where
they
found
us
the
other
day
and
follow
on
our
trail
right
youre
not
so
stupid
as
you
look
then
were
certain
of
the
first
thing
we
must
know
and
that
is
the
direction
from
which
were
to
expect
them
the
next
thing
is
to
find
out
the
time
that
cant
be
known
exactly
but
i
suppose
you
can
guess
it
pretty
closely
yes
if
a
man
has
any
brains
he
can
guess
well
enough
but
guessing
wont
do
for
us
any
one
who
acts
on
guesswork
in
such
circumstances
as
these
takes
his
skin
to
market
certainty
absolute
certainty
is
what
we
must
have
we
can
only
get
that
by
sending
out
spies
and
you
put
your
veto
on
that
you
said
the
track
of
spies
would
betray
us
indian
spies
mark
thatindian
spies
the
apaches
know
we
are
here
and
if
they
came
upon
the
footprint
of
a
white
man
it
would
not
make
them
suspicious
but
if
they
found
the
footprint
of
an
indian
it
would
be
very
different
they
would
be
warned
and
since
you
are
so
wise
can
you
guess
what
they
would
suspect
that
the
kiowas
were
here
yes
you
have
actually
guessed
it
if
i
did
not
need
my
old
wig
myself
id
crown
you
with
it
consider
it
done
thanks
sam
ill
try
to
deserve
the
honor
but
now
look
here
you
mean
that
we
should
send
white
spies
after
the
apaches
is
that
it
not
spies
only
one
is
that
enough
yes
if
that
ones
a
fellow
to
be
trusted
called
sam
hawkins
do
you
know
the
man
i
know
if
he
undertakes
a
thing
we
need
feel
no
more
anxiety
he
wont
let
the
apaches
catch
him
no
not
catch
him
but
see
him
i
mean
to
let
them
see
me
wandering
around
so
theyll
think
we
feel
as
safe
as
in
abrahams
bosom
they
wont
touch
me
because
if
i
didnt
come
back
your
suspicions
would
be
aroused
suppose
they
see
you
and
you
dont
see
them
i
hinted
i
seen
and
not
see
he
exclaimed
in
pretended
wrath
if
you
give
me
such
a
box
on
the
ear
as
that
its
all
over
between
us
sam
hawkinss
eyes
may
be
little
but
theyre
sharp
as
soon
as
i
have
seen
them
ill
slip
back
to
you
that
you
may
be
warned
when
their
spies
are
coming
and
act
perfectly
at
ease
but
theyll
see
the
kiowas
if
they
send
spies
here
i
objected
who
will
they
see
kiowas
man
tenderfoot
most
respected
youngster
do
you
think
sam
hawkinss
brains
are
made
of
cottonwool
or
tissuepaper
our
dear
friends
the
kiowas
will
be
safely
hidden
so
there
wont
be
the
smallest
trace
of
them
see
then
when
the
apache
scouts
have
gone
back
to
the
braves
ill
crawl
after
them
and
see
when
the
whole
body
moves
theyll
come
by
night
and
well
burn
our
campfire
so
we
can
be
plainly
seen
as
long
as
it
lasts
the
apaches
will
certainly
stay
hidden
we
will
let
it
burn
out
and
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
steal
over
to
the
kiowas
then
the
apaches
will
comeand
find
no
one
of
course
theyll
be
astonished
and
light
up
the
fire
again
to
look
for
us
when
we
shall
see
them
as
plainly
as
we
were
seen
before
and
well
reverse
the
game
and
fall
on
them
isnt
that
a
stroke
it
will
be
talked
of
long
and
every
one
will
say
sam
hawkins
planned
that
little
business
yes
its
very
fine
if
everything
goes
as
you
expect
and
after
that
shall
we
free
the
apaches
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
at
least
and
any
others
we
can
and
what
will
happen
to
the
rest
nothing
bad
im
sure
the
kiowas
will
be
too
busy
at
first
looking
for
the
chiefs
but
its
time
enough
to
plan
the
next
step
when
weve
got
through
this
one
what
comes
later
well
take
care
of
later
the
next
thing
to
do
is
to
select
a
good
spot
for
carrying
out
our
scheme
and
that
ill
attend
to
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
weve
talked
enough
today
tomorrow
we
must
act
he
was
right
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
now
but
await
events
the
night
was
not
very
comfortable
a
high
wind
arose
increasing
to
a
gale
and
towards
morning
it
grew
unusually
cold
for
that
region
we
were
awakened
chilled
to
our
marrows
sam
scanned
the
sky
and
then
said
apparently
we
are
going
to
have
rain
today
and
that
happens
rarely
about
here
but
is
the
very
best
thing
for
our
plan
why
i
asked
dont
you
know
why
replied
sam
look
around
here
and
see
how
the
grass
is
flattened
down
the
one
thing
i
was
afraid
of
was
that
when
the
apaches
came
it
would
show
them
that
there
was
a
greater
number
of
men
and
horses
here
than
they
saw
but
if
it
rains
it
will
wash
away
all
trace
of
this
and
the
grass
will
spring
up
again
as
fresh
as
ever
i
must
set
out
to
look
for
the
place
where
we
will
let
the
apaches
overtake
us
and
the
kiowas
must
go
with
me
before
the
rain
comes
so
it
can
wash
away
their
tracks
in
the
meantime
you
can
work
in
peace
he
went
over
to
lay
his
plan
before
the
kiowas
and
in
a
short
time
all
the
indians
rode
away
with
sam
and
his
two
companions
we
followed
them
slowly
step
by
step
as
our
work
advanced
and
towards
noon
sams
prophecy
was
fulfilled
it
rained
and
in
such
torrents
as
can
only
fall
in
those
latitudes
it
seemed
as
though
an
ocean
were
falling
from
the
skies
in
the
midst
of
this
torrent
sam
came
back
with
dick
and
will
we
did
not
see
him
until
he
was
within
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
of
us
so
thick
was
the
veil
of
rain
before
us
they
had
found
a
suitable
place
stone
and
parker
were
to
remain
and
show
it
to
us
but
in
spite
of
the
weather
hawkins
went
back
as
soon
as
he
had
laid
in
provisions
to
resume
his
office
of
spy
as
he
disappeared
in
the
thick
rain
i
felt
that
misfortune
was
close
upon
us
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
and
dread
came
over
me
like
a
pall
chapter
ix
waiting
the
onslaught
the
rain
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
began
and
the
sun
shone
down
on
us
as
warm
as
on
the
day
before
we
worked
rapidly
till
nightfall
and
a
few
hours
labor
in
the
morning
brought
us
to
a
stream
swollen
by
the
late
rain
flowing
beside
a
small
open
savanna
which
was
bordered
on
one
hand
by
trees
and
shrubs
a
wooded
peninsula
ran
out
into
the
water
and
beside
the
stream
rose
a
gentle
elevation
crowned
by
thick
woods
this
is
the
place
sam
picked
out
said
stone
looking
at
it
with
an
air
of
recognition
there
couldnt
be
a
better
place
for
our
purpose
the
kiowas
are
so
hidden
you
might
try
hard
and
not
find
the
least
trace
of
them
yet
i
know
they
see
us
perfectly
the
savanna
is
covered
with
a
growth
that
makes
it
easy
for
the
apache
spies
to
conceal
themselves
and
follow
us
unseen
then
look
at
the
open
plain
of
grass
leading
here
a
campfire
burning
on
it
will
light
all
the
savanna
and
hide
the
apaches
so
they
can
easily
come
upon
us
his
lean
weatherbeaten
face
gleamed
with
satisfaction
but
the
head
engineer
did
not
share
the
feeling
he
shook
his
head
saying
what
is
the
matter
with
you
do
you
mean
to
say
you
rejoice
that
we
can
be
so
easily
overcome
i
tell
you
its
far
from
pleasant
to
me
i
am
paralyzed
at
the
mere
thought
the
surer
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
apaches
cried
stone
dont
let
such
feelings
get
hold
of
you
mr
bancroft
of
course
im
glad
for
the
easier
the
apaches
can
overtake
us
the
easier
we
can
capture
them
just
look
here
over
there
on
the
heights
are
the
kiowas
in
the
midst
of
the
woods
their
spies
sit
in
the
highest
trees
and
have
surely
seen
us
coming
and
in
the
same
way
theyll
see
the
apaches
for
they
can
look
all
across
the
savanna
well
what
earthly
good
will
it
do
us
if
were
overtaken
to
have
the
kiowas
look
across
the
savanna
dont
you
see
they
stay
there
only
because
here
the
apaches
would
see
them
as
soon
as
their
scouts
have
come
and
gone
the
kiowas
will
come
over
to
us
hide
on
the
peninsula
and
well
put
our
horses
at
its
neck
for
then
the
apaches
will
keep
off
it
as
the
horses
would
neigh
if
they
went
near
them
and
give
us
warning
the
apaches
will
hide
and
wait
till
were
asleep
suppose
they
shouldnt
wait
i
interrupted
that
wouldnt
be
dangerous
for
us
he
replied
the
kiowas
would
come
to
our
assistance
at
once
but
then
thered
be
bloodshed
which
we
want
to
avoid
yes
but
here
in
the
west
a
drop
of
blood
doesnt
count
dont
worry
the
apaches
are
sure
to
wait
for
they
know
that
if
awake
wed
defend
ourselves
and
though
wed
get
the
worst
of
it
still
some
of
them
would
be
sure
to
get
killed
and
they
value
their
blood
as
highly
as
we
do
ours
therefore
theyll
wait
till
we
lie
down
to
sleep
then
well
let
the
fire
go
out
and
go
over
to
the
island
now
that
we
were
on
the
scene
of
action
and
the
hour
was
so
near
i
was
greatly
perturbed
in
mind
i
was
not
afraid
but
i
was
anxious
apprehensive
of
the
result
and
worried
as
to
the
fate
of
winnetou
of
whom
i
had
thought
so
much
during
the
past
few
days
that
he
had
grown
near
and
dear
to
me
although
he
was
still
my
enemy
and
it
must
have
been
a
kind
of
mental
telepathy
for
i
learned
later
that
he
had
been
thinking
continuously
of
me
since
the
encounter
could
not
be
avoided
i
wished
it
might
come
soon
and
be
over
with
and
this
wish
was
to
be
fulfilled
it
was
a
little
short
of
midday
when
we
saw
sam
hawkins
returning
the
little
man
was
weary
but
his
eyes
gleamed
with
unusual
fire
alls
well
i
asked
but
i
see
it
is
dear
old
sam
do
you
he
laughed
where
is
it
written
on
my
nose
or
in
your
imagination
no
one
who
sees
your
eyes
can
doubt
it
so
my
eyes
betray
me
thats
good
to
know
for
another
time
but
youre
right
everything
is
really
better
than
i
could
have
hoped
have
you
seen
the
spies
seen
the
spies
ive
not
only
seen
em
but
ive
seen
the
whole
band
and
not
only
seen
em
but
heard
and
watched
em
watched
them
then
tell
us
quick
what
youve
discovered
gather
up
your
instruments
and
go
into
camp
while
i
go
over
to
the
kiowas
to
tell
them
what
their
part
is
to
be
ill
be
back
pretty
soon
he
sprang
across
the
stream
and
disappeared
into
the
woods
while
we
packed
up
our
instruments
and
went
back
to
camp
to
await
his
coming
we
neither
saw
nor
heard
him
till
he
stood
among
us
saying
here
i
am
my
lords
havent
you
eyes
and
ears
now
that
shows
you
how
you
can
get
close
to
men
without
their
knowing
it
and
thats
the
way
i
did
yesterday
with
the
apaches
tell
us
tell
us
you
shall
hear
but
i
must
sit
down
for
im
pretty
tired
my
bones
are
used
to
riding
and
dont
enjoy
walking
any
more
besides
its
grander
to
belong
to
the
cavalry
than
to
the
infantry
he
sat
down
near
me
and
then
said
nodding
his
head
positively
well
have
the
ball
tonight
tonight
i
echoed
half
shocked
half
glad
thats
good
hm
you
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
apaches
however
youre
right
it
is
good
and
im
glad
too
that
we
wont
have
to
wait
any
longer
its
no
fun
waiting
when
you
dont
know
how
a
thing
will
turn
out
dont
know
is
there
any
reason
for
anxiety
not
a
bit
on
the
contrary
im
certain
everything
will
go
well
but
any
man
of
experience
knows
that
the
best
child
may
grow
up
bad
the
finest
plans
take
a
wrong
turn
from
some
unforeseen
cause
well
do
tell
us
what
you
heard
hurry
up
softly
softly
my
young
sir
everything
in
order
i
cant
tell
you
what
i
heard
because
you
must
first
know
how
i
heard
it
when
i
went
out
in
the
rain
from
here
i
went
back
to
where
we
were
camping
when
the
two
apaches
came
to
us
and
had
to
hide
at
once
for
there
were
three
redskins
sniffing
around
apache
spies
says
i
to
myself
and
so
they
were
they
surveyed
the
premises
without
coming
on
my
trail
and
sat
down
under
the
trees
where
it
was
dry
to
wait
for
their
chiefs
and
i
had
to
wait
too
two
long
hours
at
last
came
a
mounted
band
led
by
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
how
many
were
there
just
as
i
expected
about
fifty
men
the
spies
went
out
to
meet
them
and
after
a
few
words
with
their
chiefs
went
on
ahead
the
braves
following
slowly
you
may
imagine
gentlemen
that
sam
hawkins
followed
after
them
the
rain
had
washed
out
ordinary
tracks
but
the
broad
trail
of
your
camp
was
plain
i
wish
i
might
always
have
a
trail
as
easy
to
follow
but
the
indians
wanted
to
be
very
sure
for
they
peered
into
every
nook
and
corner
and
behind
every
bush
and
made
such
slow
progress
that
darkness
came
on
after
we
had
gone
only
about
two
miles
and
they
dismounted
and
made
their
camp
and
did
you
creep
up
to
them
there
yes
like
wise
fellows
they
made
no
fire
but
sam
hawkins
being
equally
wise
thought
that
served
him
as
well
as
them
so
i
crawled
under
the
trees
and
wriggled
forward
on
my
stomach
till
i
got
near
enough
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
their
words
were
brief
but
to
the
point
it
is
as
we
expected
they
want
to
capture
us
alive
and
not
kill
us
not
all
at
once
they
want
to
take
us
to
the
mascaleros
village
at
rio
pecos
where
we
are
to
be
tortured
and
die
a
living
death
like
carp
taken
out
of
the
water
and
put
into
a
pond
to
fatten
i
wonder
what
kind
of
flesh
old
sams
would
make
especially
if
they
put
me
into
the
pan
in
my
leather
huntingjacket
he
laughed
in
his
silent
inward
fashion
and
added
theyve
got
their
eye
on
mr
rattler
there
sitting
as
still
as
if
heaven
with
all
the
saints
were
waiting
for
him
yes
rattler
theyve
got
a
banquet
ready
for
you
that
i
wouldnt
care
to
sit
down
to
youre
to
be
spitted
impaled
poisoned
smothered
shot
broken
on
a
wheel
and
hanged
each
done
a
little
more
beautifully
than
the
other
and
only
a
taste
of
each
that

be
kept

long
time

grave
of
klekipetrah
whom

and
buried
alive
merciful
heaven
did
they
say
that
gasped
rattler
his
face
blanched
with
terror
thats
what
they
said
and
you
deserve
it
i
only
hope
if
you
do
escape
youll
be
half
decent
in
the
future
and
i
guess
you
will
be
for
the
body
of
klekipetrah
will
be
a
strong
medicine
for
you
where
is
the
main
band
of
the
apaches
which
is
out
against
the
kiowas
i
asked
i
dont
know
nothing
was
said
of
that
it
doesnt
matter
to
us
little
sam
was
mistaken
in
that
it
was
far
from
unimportant
to
us
where
this
band
was
as
we
discovered
in
a
few
days
sam
continued
as
i
had
heard
enough
i
should
have
come
back
to
you
at
once
but
it
was
dark
and
i
couldnt
see
the
trail
till
dawn
so
i
waited
i
stayed
all
night
hidden
in
the
wood
and
my
legs
were
almost
broken
i
was
six
miles
from
here
and
i
had
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
back
unseen
and
that
is
all
i
have
to
tell
you
but
you
said
you
were
going
to
show
yourself
to
them
i
know
and
i
should
have
done
so
onlyhark
did
you
hear
anything
the
scream
of
an
eagle
thrice
repeated
came
from
the
woods
thats
the
kiowa
spies
he
said
they
are
over
there
in
the
trees
i
told
them
to
give
me
this
sign
when
they
saw
the
apaches
on
the
savanna
come
sir
well
try
what
sort
of
eyes
you
have
this
invitation
was
addressed
to
me
sam
rose
to
go
and
i
took
my
gun
to
follow
him
hold
on
he
said
leave
that
gun
here
its
true
the
frontiersman
should
never
go
out
without
his
weapons
but
this
is
an
exception
because
we
must
not
seem
to
have
any
suspicion
of
danger
well
appear
to
be
gathering
wood
to
make
our
fire
and
the
apaches
will
conclude
we
are
going
to
stay
here
all
night
we
sauntered
out
apparently
wandering
carelessly
in
and
out
among
the
trees
and
bushes
breaking
off
the
dry
branches
we
strained
our
eyes
but
could
discover
no
one
yet
later
i
learned
from
winnetou
himself
that
fifty
feet
at
most
away
from
us
he
was
hidden
behind
a
bush
watching
us
we
gathered
more
wood
for
the
campfire
than
we
needed
for
sam
wanted
enough
in
reserve
to
enable
the
apaches
to
kindle
the
fire
quickly
when
they
discovered
we
were
gone
darkness
fell
and
we
gathered
in
the
camp
for
the
eventful
night
sam
as
the
most
experienced
sat
at
the
end
of
the
grassy
plain
nearest
the
savanna
where
he
could
see
the
coming
of
the
spies
for
whom
we
were
waiting
knowing
they
could
not
be
far
off
the
fire
blazed
up
lighting
the
plain
and
the
savanna
how
foolish
and
inexperienced
the
apaches
must
think
us
this
great
fire
was
the
very
thing
to
guide
an
enemy
to
us
from
afar
we
ate
our
supper
and
lounged
about
as
if
we
were
far
from
suspecting
any
danger
the
guns
lay
at
some
distance
back
of
us
towards
the
peninsula
ready
to
be
seized
by
us
later
in
our
flight
three
hours
after
dark
sam
stepped
back
to
us
and
said
softly
the
spies
are
coming
two
one
on
this
one
on
that
side
i
heard
and
saw
them
then
he
sat
down
with
us
and
began
to
talk
in
a
loud
voice
on
the
first
subject
that
occurred
to
him
we
answered
and
kept
up
a
conversation
intended
to
show
the
spies
how
secure
we
felt
we
knew
that
they
were
there
watching
us
but
by
a
strong
effort
we
kept
ourselves
from
glancing
towards
the
bushes
concealing
them
the
most
important
thing
now
was
to
know
when
they
had
gone
we
could
neither
hear
nor
see
anything
and
yet
we
dared
not
waste
a
moment
after
their
departure
for
in
a
short
time
the
whole
band
would
be
upon
us
and
in
that
interval
the
kiowas
must
come
over
from
the
peninsula
hence
it
was
best
not
to
wait
until
they
had
withdrawn
but
to
force
them
out
so
sam
rose
as
if
he
were
going
to
get
more
wood
and
went
into
the
bushes
on
one
side
while
i
took
the
other
we
were
now
sure
that
the
spies
were
gone
sam
put
one
hand
to
his
mouth
and
thrice
imitated
the
croaking
of
a
bullfrog
this
was
the
signal
for
the
kiowas
to
come
it
would
not
be
noticed
by
the
apaches
as
we
were
beside
the
stream
sam
then
resumed
his
office
of
watchman
to
warn
us
of
the
approach
of
the
whole
body
of
the
enemy
about
two
minutes
after
the
signal
was
given
the
kiowas
came
over
in
close
single
filea
long
line
of
two
hundred
warriors
they
had
not
waited
in
the
woods
but
had
come
down
to
the
bank
to
be
ready
for
the
signal
and
on
receiving
it
had
instantly
sprung
across
the
stream
they
crawled
behind
us
in
our
shadow
like
snakes
lying
close
to
the
ground
near
the
peninsula
this
was
done
so
quickly
and
silently
that
in
three
minutes
at
the
most
the
last
one
had
joined
us
in
a
short
time
sam
came
and
whispered
to
us
theyre
coming
on
both
sides
dont
put
on
any
more
wood
we
must
let
the
fire
die
down
and
take
care
that
an
ember
is
left
for
the
indians
to
kindle
another
we
piled
what
wood
we
had
left
around
the
fire
so
that
no
light
would
fall
upon
our
retreat
after
this
was
done
each
of
us
had
to
be
more
or
less
an
actor
we
knew
that
fifty
apaches
were
close
to
us
yet
that
we
must
not
betray
our
knowledge
by
the
slightest
sign
we
expected
them
to
wait
until
we
were
asleep
but
what
if
they
did
not
wait
but
fell
upon
us
at
once
of
course
we
had
two
hundred
allies
in
the
kiowas
but
in
that
case
there
would
be
a
bloody
struggle
that
might
easily
cost
some
of
us
our
lives
the
time
had
come
and
it
was
interesting
to
watch
the
various
effects
it
produced
on
my
comrades
rattler
lay
face
downward
on
the
ground
as
if
asleep
the
fear
of
death
gripping
his
heart
with
an
icy
hand
his
trusty
friends
glanced
at
one
another
with
blanched
faces
they
could
not
utter
a
word
to
help
on
our
forced
conversation
will
parker
and
dick
stone
sat
there
as
calmly
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
an
apache
in
the
world
sam
hawkins
made
jokes
and
i
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
at
his
nonsense
for
now
that
the
danger
was
upon
us
i
was
as
calm
as
if
we
were
about
to
play
a
game
of
whist
and
so
we
waited
chapter
x
the
capture
of
winnetou
for
more
than
an
hour
we
sat
waiting
the
attack
and
then
concluded
that
we
had
been
right
and
the
apaches
would
not
come
until
we
were
asleep
the
fire
was
getting
low
and
i
thought
there
was
no
use
in
putting
off
the
evil
hour
so
i
yawned
stretched
myself
and
said
im
tired
and
id
like
to
go
to
sleep
how
about
you
sam
ive
no
objection
he
said
the
fire
is
going
out
anyway
good
night
then
good
night
repeated
all
and
getting
back
from
the
fire
as
far
as
we
could
we
stretched
ourselves
out
at
full
length
the
flame
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
till
it
died
out
altogether
only
the
ashes
still
glowing
but
the
light
could
not
reach
us
because
of
the
wood
piled
between
us
and
the
fire
and
we
lay
entirely
in
the
shadow
now
was
the
time
to
get
quietly
very
quietly
into
safety
i
reached
for
my
gun
and
slowly
crept
away
sam
kept
at
my
side
the
others
following
when
i
reached
the
horses
i
stirred
them
up
that
the
noise
of
their
stamping
might
cover
any
possible
rustling
we
might
make
in
going
we
came
over
safely
to
the
kiowas
who
stood
like
panthers
crouching
for
prey
sam
i
whispered
if
we
want
to
spare
the
two
chiefs
we
mustnt
let
a
kiowa
get
at
them
understand
yes
ill
take
winnetou
you
and
stone
and
parker
look
after
intschutschuna
one
for
you
alone
and
one
for
us
three
together
thats
no
way
to
do
yes
it
is
ill
finish
up
winnetou
in
short
order
and
there
should
be
three
to
take
charge
of
his
father
for
his
braves
will
be
around
him
and
if
he
should
resist
it
would
cost
him
his
life
well
all
right
wed
better
go
on
a
few
steps
and
be
first
or
some
kiowa
will
get
ahead
of
us
come
we
posted
ourselves
a
little
in
advance
and
awaited
in
greatest
suspense
the
warcry
of
the
apaches
it
is
customary
for
an
indian
leader
to
give
the
signal
for
an
onslaught
by
a
cry
in
which
the
rest
join
like
demons
this
is
intended
to
deprive
the
victim
of
all
courage
and
is
well
adapted
to
its
end
the
best
idea
one
can
get
of
it
is
by
uttering
a
longdrawnout
hiiiiih
at
the
top
of
his
voice
at
the
same
time
striking
the
mouth
repeatedly
with
the
hand
to
break
the
sound
into
waves
the
kiowas
were
at
as
high
a
tension
as
we
were
each
of
them
wanted
to
be
first
and
pushed
us
forward
further
and
further
till
we
were
too
near
the
apaches
for
comfort
and
i
wished
very
heartily
the
onslaught
might
come
at
last
it
did
come
the
hiiiiih
arose
in
such
a
tone
as
to
go
through
my
very
marrow
followed
by
a
howl
as
dreadful
as
if
a
thousand
devils
had
broken
loose
we
heard
quick
steps
and
springs
over
the
soft
earth
suddenly
all
was
still
for
a
moment
we
could
almost
have
heard
an
ant
crawl
then
we
heard
intschutschuna
speak
the
short
word
ko
this
means
fire
or
make
a
fire
the
ashes
of
our
fire
were
still
smouldering
and
as
the
apaches
obeyed
him
and
threw
the
dry
wood
on
them
it
kindled
at
once
and
the
flames
leaped
up
anew
lighting
the
entire
camp
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
stood
side
by
side
and
a
circle
of
braves
gathered
around
them
as
the
apaches
saw
to
their
amazement
that
we
were
gone
uff
uff
they
grunted
in
astonishment
winnetou
then
showed
that
presence
of
mind
which
later
so
often
excited
my
wonder
he
saw
that
we
could
not
be
far
off
and
that
they
standing
in
the
full
light
of
the
fire
made
a
fine
mark
for
our
guns
therefore
he
cried
tatischa
tatischa
which
means
be
off
he
had
turned
to
spring
away
when
i
stood
before
him
and
for
a
moment
we
looked
each
other
in
the
face
quick
as
lightning
his
hand
was
at
his
knife
but
before
he
could
draw
it
i
struck
him
in
the
temple
he
staggered
and
fell
to
the
ground
and
i
saw
that
sam
will
and
dick
had
overpowered
his
father
the
apaches
howled
in
rage
but
their
cry
was
hardly
audible
for
it
was
drowned
by
the
horrible
din
of
the
kiowas
who
now
sprang
upon
them
as
i
had
broken
through
the
apache
circle
i
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
fighting
howling
tangle
of
men
struggling
together
there
were
two
hundred
kiowas
against
fifty
apaches
four
to
one
yet
these
brave
warriors
defended
themselves
with
all
their
strength
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
protect
myself
and
had
to
take
a
hand
in
the
fight
since
i
was
in
the
midst
of
it
but
i
used
my
fists
only
as
i
had
no
desire
to
harm
any
one
after
i
had
knocked
down
four
or
five
and
had
space
to
breathe
in
i
saw
the
struggle
was
becoming
feebler
and
five
minutes
after
it
began
the
whole
thing
was
over
only
five
minutes
but
under
such
circumstances
five
minutes
seem
a
long
time
intschutschuna
lay
on
the
ground
and
winnetou
beside
him
both
bound
not
an
apache
had
escaped
for
none
of
the
brave
fellows
had
once
thought
of
deserting
his
chief
and
making
off
through
the
darkness
many
of
them
were
wounded
as
were
some
of
the
kiowas
of
whom
three
were
killed
and
five
apaches
which
was
exactly
what
we
had
hoped
to
avoid
but
they
had
made
such
fierce
resistance
that
the
kiowas
had
drawn
their
knives
the
besieging
party
was
all
bound
and
now
came
the
question
of
disposing
of
the
prisoners
i
wanted
to
make
it
as
easy
for
them
as
possible
but
tangua
the
kiowa
chief
said
imperatively
these
dogs
are
ours
not
yours
and
i
will
decide
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
i
would
take
them
to
our
village
but
we
dont
want
to
be
long
on
the
way
for
their
people
might
overtake
us
and
we
have
far
to
go
we
will
put
them
to
death
by
torture
here
i
think
you
make
a
mistake
i
remarked
how
in
saying
they
belong
to
you
that
is
false
it
is
true
no
by
the
laws
of
the
west
a
prisoner
belongs
to
his
captor
take
the
apaches
you
captured
but
those
we
captured
belong
to
us
uff
uff
how
wise
you
speak
so
you
want
to
keep
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
but
what
if
i
wont
allow
it
you
will
allow
it
he
spoke
angrily
but
i
answered
him
gently
though
firmly
he
drew
his
knife
thrust
it
into
the
earth
up
to
the
handle
and
said
with
flashing
eyes
if
you
lay
a
hand
on
a
single
apache
your
body
shall
be
like
this
earth
in
which
my
knife
stands
i
have
spoken
how
this
was
said
in
deadly
earnest
but
i
would
have
shown
him
that
i
was
not
afraid
of
him
if
sam
hawkins
had
not
given
me
a
warning
glance
which
kept
me
silent
the
captive
apaches
lay
around
the
fire
and
it
would
have
been
easier
to
leave
them
there
where
they
could
be
watched
with
no
trouble
but
tangua
wanted
to
show
me
they
were
really
his
property
to
do
with
as
he
pleased
and
ordered
them
tied
to
the
trees
near
by
this
was
done
and
none
too
tenderly
the
two
chiefs
being
treated
most
roughly
and
their
fetters
drawn
so
tight
as
to
make
the
blood
burst
from
the
swollen
flesh
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
a
prisoner
to
break
away
and
escape
unaided
and
tangua
set
guards
around
the
camp
to
prevent
rescue
our
second
fire
burned
in
the
same
place
as
the
first
one
and
we
sat
around
it
alone
the
kiowas
being
as
anxious
to
stay
by
themselves
as
we
were
to
have
them
do
so
they
had
not
shown
themselves
friendly
towards
us
from
the
first
and
my
late
encounter
with
their
chief
was
not
calculated
to
make
them
more
so
the
looks
of
hatred
which
they
cast
upon
us
did
not
invite
to
confidence
and
we
felt
that
we
might
be
glad
if
we
escaped
with
no
further
clash
with
them
they
considered
themselves
the
lords
of
the
situation
and
regarded
us
as
the
big
lion
in
the
menagerie
regards
the
little
dog
he
tolerates
near
him
sam
dick
will
and
i
were
thinking
about
the
execution
of
our
plan
to
free
the
chiefs
which
was
made
the
more
difficult
in
so
far
that
only
we
could
share
in
it
we
dared
not
let
our
comrades
into
our
secret
for
they
would
certainly
oppose
it
if
not
betray
it
to
the
kiowas
we
sat
together
a
long
time
how
long
i
could
not
tell
for
i
had
not
yet
learned
to
tell
time
by
the
position
of
the
stars
but
it
must
have
been
till
a
little
past
midnight
our
companions
slept
our
fire
had
burned
low
and
all
the
kiowas
fires
were
out
but
one
sam
whispered
to
me
all
four
of
us
cannot
undertake
this
two
only
are
necessary
of
whom
of
course
im
one
i
answered
softly
not
so
fast
dear
boy
the
matter
is
at
the
risk
of
life
i
know
that
and
you
want
to
risk
your
life
yes
well
youre
a
brave
fellow
but
youd
not
only
risk
your
own
but
the
lives
of
the
two
captives
of
course
im
glad
you
admit
it
for
then
i
think
youll
leave
it
to
me
not
much
be
reasonable
you
know
nothing
about
spying
and
experience
is
necessary
for
such
a
job
it
must
be
born
in
a
man
to
do
these
things
and
then
he
must
know
how
to
use
his
talent
ill
prove
im
fit
for
it
look
here
do
you
know
whether
tangua
is
asleep
or
not
no
and
yet
it
is
important
isnt
it
yes
ill
crawl
over
and
find
out
no
but
i
will
and
prove
im
fit
for
the
other
job
suppose
youre
discovered
then
ill
say
i
wanted
to
make
sure
the
guards
were
doing
their
duty
thatll
go
but
for
mercys
sake
be
careful
if
they
see
you
theyll
suspect
you
later
of
freeing
the
apaches
if
they
get
off
they
wont
be
far
wrong
take
each
tree
and
shrub
for
a
cover
and
look
out
that
the
firelight
doesnt
fall
on
you
keep
in
the
dark
ill
keep
dark
sam
i
hope
so
and
if
you
succeed
ill
give
you
credit
for
it
and
think
maybe
after
ten
years
you
may
amount
to
something
i
stuck
my
knife
and
revolver
deep
in
my
belt
not
to
lose
them
on
the
way
and
crept
away
from
the
fire
now
as
i
tell
it
i
know
the
awful
risk
i
took
so
lightly
i
had
no
idea
of
spying
on
the
chief
i
wanted
to
set
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
free
i
had
set
my
heart
on
doing
it
myself
but
sam
hawkins
stood
in
the
way
of
my
desire
with
his
caution
even
if
i
did
succeed
in
spying
on
tangua
i
was
afraid
sam
would
not
let
me
go
to
winnetou
so
i
thought
i
would
better
make
sure
of
going
while
i
had
a
chance
in
doing
this
i
not
only
risked
my
own
life
and
the
lives
of
the
indians
but
those
of
my
comrades
for
if
i
were
discovered
it
was
all
up
with
them
and
i
knew
this
quite
well
but
it
made
little
impression
on
my
youthful
selfconfidence
nor
did
the
fact
that
i
had
never
crawled
silently
among
enemies
indian
fashion
deter
me
in
the
least
i
felt
perfectly
sure
of
success
the
distance
between
our
fire
and
the
spot
where
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
were
bound
was
not
more
than
fifty
feet
i
knew
the
best
way
to
creep
there
was
on
the
fingers
and
toes
but
it
needed
strength
in
these
members
which
i
did
not
possess
so
i
crawled
on
my
hands
and
knees
like
a
quadruped
before
i
put
a
hand
down
i
first
felt
the
spot
to
make
sure
there
were
no
twigs
that
would
crackle
under
the
weight
of
my
body
and
thus
betray
me
and
if
i
had
to
go
under
or
between
branches
i
tested
them
carefully
to
make
sure
that
i
could
get
through
so
of
course
i
went
slowly
very
very
slowly
but
i
did
make
some
progress
the
apaches
were
tied
to
trees
on
each
side
of
the
grassy
plain
the
two
chiefs
on
the
left
from
our
campfire
the
trees
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
grass
and
scarcely
five
feet
away
sat
the
indian
appointed
especially
to
watch
them
because
of
their
importance
this
would
make
my
task
very
difficult
perhaps
impossible
but
i
had
a
plan
for
distracting
his
attention
at
least
for
a
moment
though
to
carry
it
out
i
needed
stones
and
none
seemed
to
be
within
reach
i
had
put
perhaps
half
my
way
behind
me
and
had
been
gone
over
half
an
hourtwentyfive
feet
in
half
an
hourwhen
i
saw
something
gleaming
at
one
side
and
crawling
over
to
it
found
to
my
great
delight
a
small
depression
in
the
earth
filled
with
sand
that
was
washed
into
it
by
the
recent
rain
and
the
overflow
of
the
little
stream
i
filled
my
pocket
with
the
sand
and
crept
on
after
another
good
halfhour
i
found
myself
at
last
behind
winnetou
and
his
father
possibly
four
feet
away
the
trees
to
which
they
were
bound
with
their
backs
towards
me
were
not
broad
enough
to
cover
me
but
luckily
a
leafy
branch
stood
out
at
the
foot
of
them
which
hid
me
from
the
guard
a
few
feet
behind
him
again
there
was
a
thorny
bush
upon
which
i
had
designs
i
crawled
first
behind
winnetou
and
there
lay
still
a
few
minutes
to
observe
the
guard
he
seemed
tired
for
his
eyes
drooped
as
if
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
keep
them
open
for
which
i
was
grateful
now
i
must
find
out
how
winnetou
was
fastened
i
reached
cautiously
around
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
felt
of
his
feet
and
legs
of
course
he
perceived
this
and
i
feared
he
would
make
a
movement
which
would
betray
me
but
he
was
much
too
wise
and
had
too
much
presence
of
mind
for
that
i
found
his
feet
were
tied
together
and
bound
by
a
thong
to
the
tree
so
that
two
knifecuts
would
be
necessary
i
saw
by
the
flickering
firelight
that
his
hands
were
crossed
from
right
to
left
and
bound
backward
to
the
tree
and
one
cut
would
suffice
to
loose
them
now
something
occurred
to
me
of
which
i
had
not
thought
before
when
winnetou
was
freed
he
might
take
to
flight
instantly
and
that
would
put
me
in
the
greatest
danger
i
thought
and
thought
but
could
find
no
way
out
of
the
difficulty
i
must
risk
it
and
if
the
apache
sprang
away
at
once
i
must
save
myself
with
equal
speed
how
mistaken
i
was
in
winnetou
i
did
not
know
him
we
have
discussed
his
liberation
since
and
he
has
told
me
that
when
he
first
felt
my
hand
he
believed
it
to
be
an
apaches
true
all
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
were
captured
but
it
was
possible
that
he
had
been
followed
by
a
scout
to
bring
him
news
of
the
main
body
of
his
braves
he
was
sure
that
he
was
to
be
freed
and
waited
confidently
the
cutting
of
his
bonds
but
he
certainly
would
not
fly
at
once
for
he
would
not
go
without
his
father
nor
would
he
endanger
the
life
of
him
who
freed
him
i
cut
the
two
lower
bands
the
upper
ones
i
could
not
reach
in
my
present
position
without
risk
of
cutting
winnetous
hands
so
i
must
stand
up
and
it
was
nearly
certain
the
guard
would
see
me
but
i
had
brought
the
sand
for
such
a
moment
i
thrust
my
hand
into
my
pocket
took
out
a
handful
of
it
and
threw
it
past
the
guard
into
the
bush
behind
him
this
made
a
rustle
the
indian
turned
and
looked
at
the
bush
a
second
handful
aroused
his
attention
thoroughlya
poisonous
reptile
might
be
hidden
in
thereand
he
rose
turned
around
and
examined
it
carefully
quick
as
a
flash
i
had
cut
the
thongs
in
doing
so
i
felt
winnetous
splendid
hair
in
my
eyes
and
i
seized
a
strand
in
my
left
hand
cut
it
off
with
the
right
and
then
sank
to
the
ground
again
why
did
i
do
this
to
have
proof
that
it
was
really
i
who
had
freed
him
to
my
delight
winnetou
did
not
make
the
slightest
motion
but
stood
precisely
as
before
i
wound
the
hair
into
a
ring
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
then
i
crawled
behind
intschutschuna
whose
fastenings
i
examined
as
i
had
winnetous
and
found
him
bound
exactly
as
his
son
had
been
and
he
remained
equally
unmoved
when
he
felt
my
hand
again
i
cut
the
lower
thongs
first
then
i
succeeded
in
distracting
the
guards
attention
as
before
and
freed
the
chiefs
hands
he
was
as
considerate
as
his
son
and
made
no
movement
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
let
the
thongs
lie
on
the
ground
for
if
the
kiowas
found
them
cut
they
might
suspect
us
so
i
took
intschutschunas
bands
away
crept
back
to
winnetou
and
got
his
and
then
began
my
journey
back
i
had
to
make
what
haste
i
could
for
when
the
chiefs
disappeared
an
alarm
would
at
once
be
given
and
i
dared
not
be
anywhere
around
i
crawled
farther
into
the
bushes
to
be
out
of
sight
if
this
happened
and
made
my
way
back
faster
than
i
had
come
but
still
cautiously
when
i
got
close
to
the
camp
i
lay
flat
and
made
the
rest
of
the
way
by
wriggling
along
my
three
comrades
were
alarmed
about
me
and
as
i
again
lay
down
between
them
sam
whispered
we
were
worried
about
you
do
you
know
how
long
youve
been
almost
two
hours
i
shouldnt
wonder
half
an
hour
going
and
half
an
hour
coming
and
an
hour
there
why
on
earth
did
you
stay
so
long
to
be
sure
the
chief
was
asleep
good
gracious
dick
and
will
hear
this
tenderfoot
to
make
sure
the
chief
was
asleep
he
stared
at
him
a
whole
hour
never
mind
i
proved
to
you
i
could
crawl
i
was
keeping
my
eyes
strained
on
the
two
apaches
wondering
why
they
delayed
going
the
reason
was
very
simple
each
was
uncertain
that
the
other
had
been
freed
and
they
stayed
for
a
signal
from
their
liberator
as
this
was
not
forthcoming
winnetou
waited
till
he
saw
the
guards
eyelids
droop
when
he
motioned
with
his
hand
to
his
father
and
the
chief
returned
the
signal
then
they
disappeared
from
their
places
yes
you
have
given
us
proof
said
sam
hawkins
answering
my
last
remark
but
if
you
think
you
could
free
the
two
chiefs
by
piercing
their
bonds
with
your
eyes
for
one
full
precious
hour
youre
mistaken
its
a
difficult
thing
anyway
im
not
sure
it
can
be
done
but
if
it
cangood
heavens
what
is
that
that
instant
the
apaches
had
vanished
i
pretended
not
to
see
and
asked
whats
up
why
dont
you
go
on
becauseam
i
blind
or
not
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
cried
yes
by
thunder
its
so
look
yonder
are
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
there
before
any
one
could
answer
the
guard
sprang
up
stared
a
moment
at
the
deserted
trees
and
then
uttered
a
piercing
cry
that
awakened
every
sleeper
the
guard
announced
in
his
own
vernacular
what
had
happened
and
a
tumult
began
which
was
beyond
description
every
one
ran
to
the
trees
white
men
and
red
i
following
but
on
my
way
i
turned
my
pocket
wrong
side
out
and
got
rid
of
the
rest
of
the
sand
more
than
two
hundred
men
surrounded
the
spot
on
which
but
a
moment
before
the
two
chiefs
had
stood
a
howl
of
rage
arose
which
told
me
plainly
what
would
be
my
fate
if
the
truth
came
to
light
tangua
ordered
half
his
men
to
disperse
over
the
savanna
and
search
for
the
missing
men
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
darkness
he
actually
foamed
with
rage
he
struck
the
negligent
guard
in
the
face
tore
his
medicinecharm
from
his
neck
and
trod
it
under
foot
this
was
an
everlasting
disgrace
for
the
medicinecharm
means
everything
to
an
indian
and
to
lose
it
is
to
lose
honor
and
be
an
outcast
from
his
tribe
until
he
shall
rehabilitate
himself
by
killing
an
enemy
and
seizing
his
charm
which
will
then
be
considered
as
the
victors
own
the
guard
took
his
bitter
punishment
without
a
word
shouldered
his
gun
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
the
chiefs
rage
was
directed
not
only
against
this
unfortunate
indian
but
against
me
he
strode
up
to
me
and
shrieked
you
wanted
to
keep
those
two
dogs
for
yourself
go
after
them
and
catch
them
i
was
turning
from
him
without
answering
but
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
saying
did
you
hear
my
command
obey
i
shook
him
off
and
replied
you
cannot
order
me
to
obey
you
yes
for
i
am
the
chief
of
all
this
camp
i
drew
from
my
pocket
the
tin
box
in
which
i
kept
my
papers
and
said
shall
i
give
you
your
proper
answer
and
blow
up
all
your
people
speak
another
word
to
displease
me
and
ill
destroy
you
all
with
this
medicine
that
blows
up
the
mountains
i
was
doubtful
that
this
absurd
statement
would
be
believed
but
it
was
he
drew
back
crying
uff
uff
keep
your
medicine
for
yourself
and
be
a
dog
like
the
apaches
we
white
men
went
back
to
our
fire
and
naturally
the
topic
of
conversation
was
the
escape
and
how
it
came
about
i
did
not
reveal
the
secret
even
to
sam
dick
or
will
i
was
very
happy
in
its
possession
and
at
the
success
of
my
attempt
which
every
moment
of
the
vain
search
for
the
fugitives
made
more
certain
the
lock
of
winnetous
hair
i
have
kept
through
all
my
wanderings
in
the
west
and
i
have
it
safe
today
a
reminder
not
only
of
a
mad
adventure
but
of
a
true
friend
chapter
xi
a
difference
of
opinion
the
kiowas
manner
was
such
as
to
convince
us
that
we
would
do
well
to
look
after
our
own
safety
and
we
dared
not
lie
down
to
rest
without
leaving
one
of
our
party
on
guard
we
spent
the
night
sleeping
by
turns
and
early
in
the
morning
our
sentinel
awakened
us
to
say
that
the
kiowas
were
following
the
trail
of
the
fugitives
for
which
they
had
been
obliged
to
wait
till
dawn
we
in
turn
followed
them
and
the
trail
led
us
to
the
spot
where
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
had
left
their
horses
and
where
they
had
mounted
and
ridden
away
we
surveyors
resumed
our
work
we
dared
not
lose
a
moment
for
the
indians
were
sure
to
return
to
rescue
their
comrades
and
execute
their
twofold
revenge
and
we
could
not
know
how
soon
this
might
be
for
we
had
no
idea
where
the
main
body
of
the
apaches
lay
we
worked
hard
till
noon
when
sam
hawkins
came
to
me
and
said
there
seems
to
be
something
up
among
the
kiowas
in
regard
to
the
prisoners
something
dont
you
know
what
they
seem
to
be
getting
ready
to
kill
them
and
to
do
it
soon
for
they
are
preparing
the
torture
now
we
must
stop
that
now
look
here
the
kiowas
are
two
hundred
strong
do
you
mean
to
say
you
can
stop
their
doing
what
they
please
i
hope
not
to
be
obliged
to
do
it
alone
i
count
on
you
and
dick
and
will
and
i
have
full
confidence
you
wont
forsake
me
but
will
do
your
utmost
to
prevent
such
wholesale
murder
so
you
have
confidence
in
us
im
very
grateful
for
it
for
its
no
trifle
to
have
the
confidence
of
such
a
man
as
you
listen
sam
im
in
earnest
the
fate
of
so
many
men
is
not
a
subject
for
jesting
he
gave
me
a
whimsical
glance
out
of
his
little
eyes
the
dickens
so
youre
in
earnest
then
i
must
pull
a
long
face
but
do
you
consider
the
situation
we
are
only
four
against
two
hundred
for
we
cant
count
on
the
others
do
you
think
we
could
possibly
succeed
or
do
you
mean
to
live
up
to
your
new
name
of
old
shatterhand
and
knock
down
all
the
two
hundred
warriors
with
your
fist
nonsense
i
didnt
give
myself
that
name
and
i
know
well
enough
we
cant
do
anything
against
two
hundred
but
must
it
come
to
force
cunning
is
often
better
now
i
wonder
if
you
read
that
in
your
books
youll
become
prudent
if
you
dont
look
out
and
id
like
to
see
how
youd
seem
in
that
shape
i
tell
you
theres
nothing
to
be
done
here
with
all
your
cunning
the
indians
will
do
what
they
please
and
not
care
a
rap
whether
you
like
it
or
lump
it
all
right
i
see
i
cant
depend
on
you
and
ill
have
to
act
alone
for
mercys
sake
dont
do
anything
foolish
you
wont
have
to
act
alone
for
whatever
you
do
well
stand
by
you
but
its
not
been
my
habit
to
run
my
head
against
thick
walls
for
i
know
the
walls
are
harder
than
the
head
and
i
never
said
id
do
the
impossible
but
if
theres
any
way
to
save
the
apaches
we
must
find
it
certainly
but
what
way
is
there
ive
been
thinking
id
force
the
chief
to
do
my
will
by
holding
a
knife
to
his
breast
and
stab
him
if
he
wouldnt
give
in
yes
good
powers
above
youre
mad
he
cried
shocked
i
assure
you
ill
try
it
itsits
sam
checked
himself
his
surprised
and
anxious
face
taking
on
another
expression
until
at
last
he
said
i
dont
know
as
its
such
a
bad
idea
after
all
nothing
but
force
would
make
tangua
yield
and
with
a
knife
at
his
breast
he
mightwell
actually
a
greenhorn
can
have
a
small
socalled
idea
once
in
a
while
the
first
thing
is
to
get
the
chief
away
from
his
braves
where
is
he
now
over
there
with
them
will
you
get
him
off
sam
tell
him
i
want
to
speak
to
him
and
cant
leave
my
work
i
doubt
if
thatll
work
however
ill
try
suppose
he
brings
some
of
his
men
with
him
ill
leave
them
to
you
and
stone
and
parker
ill
take
care
of
tangua
have
thongs
ready
to
bind
him
the
thing
must
be
done
quietly
and
quickly
well
i
dont
know
how
the
plans
going
to
work
but
as
nothing
else
occurs
to
me
you
shall
have
your
way
we
risk
our
lives
and
i
have
no
desire
to
die
but
i
think
we
may
come
out
of
it
with
a
black
eye
he
laughed
in
his
usual
quiet
manner
and
went
off
my
companions
were
too
far
away
to
have
heard
what
we
had
been
saying
and
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
tell
them
our
plan
for
i
was
sure
they
would
have
prevented
its
execution
they
valued
their
own
lives
more
than
those
of
the
captive
apaches
and
i
realized
what
a
risk
i
ran
but
i
felt
i
ought
to
give
stone
and
parker
a
chance
to
withdraw
if
they
chose
and
asked
them
if
they
wanted
to
take
a
hand
in
the
game
stone
replied
what
is
the
matter
with
you
do
you
think
were
sneaks
to
leave
a
friend
in
the
lurch
your
scheme
is
a
stroke
worthy
of
a
true
frontiersman
and
well
be
glad
to
take
a
hand
isnt
that
so
will
yes
said
parker
id
like
to
see
if
we
four
aint
the
fellows
to
beat
two
hundred
indians
i
went
on
measuring
and
did
not
look
back
until
stone
cried
get
ready
theyre
coming
i
looked
and
saw
sam
approaching
with
tangua
and
three
other
indians
a
man
for
each
i
said
ill
take
the
chief
throttle
them
so
they
cant
scream
and
wait
till
i
grab
tangua
dont
move
first
we
went
over
towards
the
indians
and
took
up
our
position
where
a
bush
screened
us
from
the
rest
of
the
kiowas
left
to
guard
the
prisoners
the
chiefs
face
was
none
too
friendly
and
he
said
in
equally
unfriendly
tone
as
he
came
up
the
paleface
called
old
shatterhand
has
asked
me
to
come
have
you
forgotten
i
am
chief
of
the
kiowas
and
you
should
have
come
to
me
not
i
to
you
i
know
you
are
the
chief
i
answered
i
have
come
because
you
have
been
a
short
time
among
us
and
have
yet
to
learn
politeness
speak
briefly
for
i
have
no
time
what
have
you
to
do
that
is
so
important
we
are
going
to
make
the
apache
dogs
howl
why
so
soon
i
thought
you
were
going
to
take
them
to
your
village
and
torture
them
in
the
presence
of
your
women
and
children
we
wanted
to
but
they
would
hinder
us
on
the
warpath
whither
we
now
go
so
we
shall
kill
them
today
i
ask
you
not
to
do
this
it
is
not
for
you
to
ask
cant
you
speak
as
civilly
as
i
do
to
you
i
only
said
i
asked
you
if
i
had
commanded
you
you
might
have
had
an
excuse
for
being
rude
i
want
to
hear
nothing
from
you
and
a
command
is
out
of
the
question
no
paleface
shall
meddle
in
my
affairs
have
you
a
right
to
kill
the
prisoners
no
dont
answer
for
i
know
what
you
will
say
but
there
is
a
difference
between
putting
men
to
death
quickly
and
painlessly
and
slowly
torturing
them
we
shall
never
allow
that
where
we
are
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
said
scornfully
whom
do
you
think
i
am
compared
with
me
you
are
like
a
toad
which
would
attack
a
bear
of
the
rockies
the
prisoners
are
mine
and
i
shall
do
what
i
please
with
them
they
fell
into
your
hands
by
our
help
so
we
have
the
same
right
to
them
that
you
have
and
we
wish
them
to
live
wish
what
you
please
you
white
cur
i
laugh
at
your
words
he
spat
at
me
and
would
have
turned
away
but
i
let
drive
and
knocked
him
down
he
had
a
hard
skull
however
and
not
being
quite
unconscious
tried
to
rise
so
i
had
to
give
him
another
blow
before
i
could
pay
any
attention
to
the
others
i
saw
sam
hawkins
kneeling
on
an
indian
whom
he
had
seized
by
the
throat
stone
and
parker
held
the
second
one
down
while
the
third
ran
shrieking
away
i
came
to
sams
assistance
and
we
bound
our
man
as
dick
and
will
finished
up
theirs
that
was
foolish
of
you
why
did
you
let
the
third
escape
i
said
because
stone
and
i
went
for
the
same
one
we
lost
only
two
seconds
by
it
but
it
was
enough
to
let
that
rascal
escape
no
matter
said
sam
it
only
means
that
the
ball
will
begin
earlier
in
two
or
three
minutes
the
indians
will
be
upon
us
and
we
must
take
care
to
have
a
free
field
between
us
the
surveyors
had
seen
our
action
with
horror
and
the
head
engineer
came
bounding
over
to
us
crying
what
is
the
matter
with
you
people
what
have
you
done
we
shall
all
be
killed
you
certainly
will
if
you
dont
join
us
now
said
sam
call
your
people
over
here
and
come
with
us
well
protect
you
protect
us
bancroft
began
but
sam
interrupted
him
silence
the
little
man
said
sternly
we
know
what
were
about
if
you
dont
stick
to
us
youre
lost
come
on
we
carried
the
three
indians
to
the
open
prairie
where
we
halted
and
laid
them
down
for
we
knew
an
open
plain
where
we
could
see
all
around
was
safer
than
a
position
that
afforded
hidingplaces
scarcely
had
we
got
there
than
we
heard
the
kiowas
howls
of
rage
and
after
a
moment
they
came
running
towards
us
but
as
one
ran
faster
than
another
they
were
strung
out
in
a
long
line
not
coming
in
a
solid
body
which
was
lucky
for
us
as
in
the
latter
case
it
would
have
been
harder
to
bring
them
to
a
stand
plucky
little
sam
went
a
short
distance
towards
them
and
threw
up
both
arms
as
a
signal
to
stop
i
heard
him
call
out
something
which
i
did
not
understand
it
had
no
effect
until
it
was
repeated
then
i
saw
the
first
kiowa
as
well
as
the
one
next
to
him
pause
sam
spoke
to
them
pointing
at
us
then
i
called
upon
stone
and
parker
to
raise
the
chief
and
swung
a
knife
over
his
breast
the
indians
howled
indignantly
sam
spoke
further
to
them
and
then
one
of
them
next
to
tangua
in
authority
came
out
from
the
rest
and
proceeded
towards
us
as
they
came
up
sam
pointed
at
our
three
prisoners
and
said
you
see
i
spoke
the
truth
they
are
entirely
in
our
power
the
underchief
whose
face
betrayed
the
fury
within
him
replied
i
see
that
these
two
indians
are
alive
but
the
chief
seems
to
be
dead
he
is
not
dead
old
shatterhands
fist
knocked
him
down
and
he
is
unconscious
but
he
will
soon
revive
sit
down
and
wait
when
the
chief
comes
to
himself
again
we
will
treat
with
you
but
the
moment
one
of
the
kiowas
touches
a
weapon
old
shatterhands
knife
will
be
plunged
into
tanguas
heart
how
dare
you
raise
your
hand
against
us
who
are
your
friends
friends
you
dont
believe
that
yourself
when
you
say
it
i
do
believe
it
have
we
not
smoked
the
pipe
of
peace
together
yes
but
we
cant
trust
this
peace
is
it
customary
for
friends
to
insult
one
another
no
yet
your
chief
insulted
old
shatterhand
see
he
begins
to
move
tangua
whom
stone
and
parker
had
laid
down
again
raised
himself
looking
at
us
at
first
as
though
he
did
not
feel
sure
what
had
happened
then
he
recovered
consciousness
perfectly
and
cried
take
off
these
bands
why
did
you
not
listen
to
my
request
i
asked
you
cant
give
orders
here
he
gave
me
a
look
of
rage
and
snarled
silence
boy
or
ill
tear
your
eyes
out
silence
is
more
fit
for
you
than
for
me
i
answered
you
insulted
me
and
i
knocked
you
down
old
shatterhand
does
not
let
go
unpunished
him
who
calls
him
a
toad
and
a
white
dog
i
will
be
free
in
a
moment
if
you
do
not
obey
me
my
warriors
shall
wipe
you
from
off
the
earth
youd
go
first
hear
what
i
have
to
say
there
stand
your
people
if
one
of
them
moves
a
foot
without
permission
my
knife
goes
into
your
heart
how
i
set
the
knifepoint
against
his
breast
he
saw
that
he
was
in
our
power
and
could
not
doubt
that
i
would
fulfil
my
threat
there
was
a
pause
during
which
he
seemed
to
long
to
annihilate
us
with
his
wildly
rolling
eyes
then
he
tried
to
control
his
rage
and
asked
more
mildly
what
do
you
want
of
me
nothing
except
what
i
have
already
told
you
that
the
apaches
shall
not
die
by
torture
then
you
ask
that
they
shall
not
die
do
with
them
later
what
you
will
but
while
we
are
with
you
nothing
must
happen
to
them
again
he
considered
a
while
in
silence
through
the
warpaint
on
his
face
we
saw
pass
over
it
varying
expressions
of
anger
hatred
and
malice
i
expected
that
the
contest
of
words
between
us
would
be
long
so
wondered
not
a
little
when
he
said
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
yes
i
will
do
more
than
that
if
you
will
fulfil
the
condition
i
will
make
what
is
the
condition
first
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
need
not
think
i
fear
your
knife
if
you
stabbed
me
you
would
be
torn
to
shreds
in
a
moment
by
my
warriors
no
matter
how
strong
you
are
you
cannot
fight
two
hundred
foes
so
i
laugh
at
your
threat
to
stab
me
if
i
told
you
i
would
not
do
as
you
wish
you
could
do
nothing
to
me
nevertheless
the
apache
dogs
shall
not
be
tortured
i
will
even
promise
not
to
kill
them
if
you
will
fight
in
a
lifeanddeath
combat
for
them
with
whom
with
one
of
my
warriors
whom
i
will
choose
what
weapons
only
knives
if
he
kills
you
the
apaches
must
also
die
but
if
you
kill
him
they
shall
live
and
be
free
yes
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
he
considered
me
the
most
dangerous
of
his
white
allies
and
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
for
it
goes
without
saying
that
his
champion
would
be
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
knife
nevertheless
after
short
consideration
i
answered
i
agree
we
will
smoke
the
pipe
of
covenant
then
the
combat
may
begin
what
are
you
talking
about
cried
sam
you
cant
be
so
foolish
as
to
go
into
such
a
fight
it
is
not
folly
my
dear
sam
the
greatest
folly
possible
in
a
fair
fight
the
chances
would
be
equal
but
theyre
far
from
so
here
did
you
ever
have
a
fight
to
the
death
with
knives
no
there
you
see
your
opponent
will
of
course
be
skilled
with
the
knife
and
then
think
of
the
consequences
of
such
a
fight
if
you
die
the
apaches
die
too
but
if
you
kill
your
adversary
who
is
the
worse
for
it
no
one
but
if
i
win
the
apaches
get
their
lives
and
freedom
do
you
really
believe
that
certainly
for
it
will
be
sealed
by
the
solemn
pipe
of
covenant
the
devils
truth
will
be
in
such
an
oath
which
covers
some
double
meaning
and
even
if
it
is
meant
honestly
you
are
a
tenderfoot
and
now
give
us
a
rest
with
your
tenderfoot
sam
i
interrupted
youve
been
shown
that
this
tenderfoot
knows
what
he
is
about
although
dick
stone
and
will
parker
joined
sam
in
imploring
me
to
give
up
the
bargain
i
persisted
and
at
last
sam
cried
impatiently
no
good
boys
he
must
go
on
running
his
thick
head
against
stone
walls
ill
say
no
more
against
it
but
ill
see
its
a
fair
fight
and
woe
to
him
who
cheats
you
ill
blow
him
into
a
thousand
pieces
with
my
liddy
and
theyll
be
lost
in
the
clouds
the
arrangements
for
the
combat
were
now
made
two
circles
were
drawn
in
the
sand
touching
each
other
and
forming
a
figure
each
contestant
was
to
stand
in
one
of
these
circles
and
not
step
beyond
it
during
the
combat
there
was
to
be
no
quarter
one
must
die
and
his
friends
would
not
take
revenge
on
his
conqueror
when
everything
was
ready
the
bonds
were
removed
from
the
chief
and
we
smoked
the
pipe
that
sealed
his
promise
to
me
the
two
other
prisoners
were
freed
and
the
four
indians
went
off
to
fetch
their
champion
and
summon
the
braves
to
see
the
combat
the
surveyors
all
protested
with
me
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
their
words
and
sam
said
you
are
a
marvellously
rash
fellow
you
will
be
killed
and
what
shall
i
do
in
my
old
age
i
must
have
a
tenderfoot
to
abuse
whom
shall
i
scold
if
you
are
gone
some
other
tenderfoot
thats
easier
said
than
done
for
ill
never
have
another
outandout
hopeless
greenhorn
such
as
you
are
in
all
my
life
let
me
take
your
place
its
no
matter
if
an
old
fellow
dies
but
a
young
now
hold
your
kind
tongue
my
dear
old
sam
i
interrupted
its
better
a
hopeless
greenhorn
should
die
than
a
valuable
experienced
scout
but
i
hope
i
shant
die
well
id
rather
take
your
place
but
if
i
cant
promise
me
to
remember
its
for
life
or
death
dont
come
any
of
your
humane
nonsense
remember
youre
not
dealing
with
a
knight
or
a
square
man
but
a
rascal
and
a
murderer
who
will
kill
you
if

hush
here
they
come
chapter
xii
a
duel
and
capture
by
the
apaches
the
indians
came
slowly
towards
us
not
all
but
a
large
number
of
them
for
tangua
had
left
a
portion
of
them
to
guard
the
apaches
on
reaching
the
spot
a
hollow
square
was
formed
of
which
three
sides
were
filled
in
by
kiowas
our
men
occupying
the
fourth
side
the
chief
then
gave
a
signal
and
from
the
ranks
of
the
indians
strode
a
warrior
whose
proportions
were
absolutely
gigantic
laying
aside
all
his
weapons
except
his
knife
he
stripped
off
his
clothing
to
his
waist
no
one
could
look
upon
his
knotted
muscles
and
not
be
anxious
for
me
the
chief
led
him
into
the
middle
of
the
square
and
announced
to
us
in
a
voice
ringing
with
the
certainty
of
triumph
here
stands
metanakva
lightning
knife
the
strongest
warrior
of
the
kiowas
whose
knife
no
man
has
withstood
his
enemy
dies
beneath
his
blows
as
though
struck
by
lightning
he
will
fight
old
shatterhand
the
paleface
lord
help
us
whispered
sam
to
me
hes
a
real
goliath
my
dear
boy
its
all
up
with
you
nonsense
dont
forget
theres
only
one
way
to
conquer
this
fellow
and
that
is
to
make
the
fight
a
short
one
let
the
end
be
quick
for
he
can
tire
you
out
and
then
youre
lost
hows
your
pulse
he
put
his
fingers
on
my
wrist
counted
and
then
said
thank
god
not
more
than
sixty
beats
and
perfectly
regular
youre
not
excited
arent
you
a
bit
afraid
it
wouldnt
do
to
be
upset
or
afraid
in
a
case
that
depends
on
calm
blood
and
eye
the
chief
has
selected
this
giant
because
he
is
invincible
and
well
see
whether
he
really
is
so
or
not
while
i
was
talking
i
too
had
stripped
the
upper
part
of
my
body
for
although
it
was
not
necessary
i
did
not
wish
it
to
appear
that
i
desired
to
shield
myself
from
the
knife
i
gave
my
gun
and
revolver
to
sam
and
stepped
forth
into
the
middle
of
the
square
one
could
almost
see
the
throbbing
of
good
sam
hawkins
heart
but
i
felt
undisturbed
and
confidence
is
the
first
requisite
for
a
combat
the
chief
summoned
us
to
take
our
places
lightning
knife
looked
me
over
contemptuously
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
the
body
of
this
feeble
paleface
throbs
with
fear
is
he
afraid
to
enter
the
ring
scarcely
had
these
words
been
uttered
than
i
stepped
into
the
southward
circle
thus
bringing
my
back
towards
the
sun
while
it
shone
into
my
adversarys
eyes
and
blinded
him
this
may
seem
like
taking
an
unfair
advantage
but
considering
i
had
never
fought
with
knives
before
while
he
was
renowned
for
his
skill
with
them
this
did
not
make
up
for
the
advantages
on
his
side
and
it
was
perfectly
fair
tenderness
towards
my
opponent
was
worse
than
foolish
any
weakness
on
my
part
would
not
only
have
cost
me
my
life
but
the
lives
of
the
apaches
for
whom
i
fought
so
though
a
lifeanddeath
combat
is
a
horrible
thing
i
was
forced
to
do
my
best
to
kill
this
hercules
he
is
actually
going
to
try
laughed
lightning
knife
scornfully
my
knife
shall
drink
his
blood
the
great
spirit
gives
him
into
my
hand
by
taking
away
his
senses
among
indians
this
sort
of
preliminary
fight
with
tongues
is
customary
and
i
should
have
been
considered
cowardly
if
i
had
stood
silent
so
i
answered
you
fight
with
the
mouth
but
i
have
here
a
knife
take
your
place
if
you
are
not
afraid
he
bounded
into
the
other
circle
crying
angrily
afraid
metanakva
afraid
did
you
hear
that
ye
kiowa
braves
i
will
have
this
white
dogs
life
with
my
first
stroke
my
first
stroke
will
be
the
end
of
you
now
silence
you
should
not
be
called
metanakva
but
avatya
big
mouth
avatya
avatya
this
coyote
pig
dares
insult
me
my
blade
shall
eat
his
bowels
this
last
threat
was
very
shortsighted
on
his
part
for
it
gave
me
a
hint
as
to
the
manner
and
place
in
which
his
weapon
would
be
used
so
he
did
not
mean
to
stab
my
heart
but
give
a
knifethrust
below
and
rip
my
body
we
stood
quite
close
so
that
neither
had
to
bend
much
to
reach
his
foe
metanakvas
right
arm
hung
straight
down
he
held
the
knife
so
that
the
hilt
rested
on
his
little
finger
and
the
blade
stuck
out
from
between
the
thumb
and
indexfinger
the
edge
turned
upward
this
showed
that
i
was
right
he
intended
to
strike
upward
from
below
for
if
he
were
going
to
strike
downward
he
would
have
held
the
knife
in
the
opposite
way
that
is
so
that
the
hilt
lay
against
the
thumb
with
the
blade
thrust
outward
through
the
fist
by
the
little
finger
then
i
knew
the
way
in
which
i
was
to
be
attacked
now
the
main
thing
was
to
know
the
exact
moment
which
his
eyes
would
tell
me
i
knew
the
peculiar
flash
of
the
eyes
which
in
such
cases
precedes
a
blow
i
dropped
my
eyelids
to
let
him
feel
more
secure
but
only
watched
him
closer
through
the
lashes
strike
dog
he
cried
be
silent
and
act
you
red
thief
i
replied
that
was
a
great
insult
which
must
be
followed
either
by
an
angry
answer
or
the
attack
and
the
latter
thereupon
ensued
an
angry
dilation
of
his
pupil
warned
me
and
the
next
moment
his
right
arm
struck
quickly
and
forcibly
upward
to
rip
my
body
like
an
old
coat
had
i
been
looking
for
a
blow
downward
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
me
but
i
parried
his
thrust
with
my
knife
and
cut
him
deeply
in
the
forearm
dog
swine
he
shrieked
dropping
his
knife
in
rage
and
pain
dont
talk
fight
i
said
raising
my
arm
and
then
my
knife
was
in
his
heart
up
to
the
hilt
i
instantly
drew
it
out
the
stroke
was
so
true
that
a
little
stream
of
red
blood
spurted
out
on
me
my
foe
swung
backward
and
forward
groaned
and
fell
to
the
earth
dead
a
wrathful
howl
burst
from
the
indians
but
only
the
chief
moved
he
came
out
from
the
others
and
knelt
by
my
adversary
examined
the
wound
rose
and
gave
me
a
look
which
i
shall
not
soon
forget
it
was
eloquent
of
fear
hatred
amazement
and
admiration
he
would
have
gone
away
without
a
word
but
i
said
do
you
see
that
i
am
still
in
my
place
while
metanakva
has
left
his
who
has
conquered
you
have
he
answered
angrily
and
went
away
but
after
taking
five
or
six
steps
he
turned
back
and
snarled
at
me
you
are
a
white
son
of
the
wicked
spirit
our
medicinemen
will
find
out
your
charm
and
then
you
shall
give
up
your
life
to
us
do
what
you
like
with
your
medicinemen
but
keep
your
word
with
us
what
word
he
asked
haughtily
that
the
apaches
should
not
be
killed
we
will
not
kill
them
i
have
said
it
and
will
hold
to
it
and
they
shall
be
free
yes
they
shall
be
free
what
tangua
the
chief
of
the
kiowas
has
said
shall
be
done
then
i
will
go
with
my
friends
and
untie
them
i
will
do
that
myself
when
the
time
comes
it
has
come
for
i
have
conquered
silence
did
we
speak
of
the
time
it
was
not
specified
but
it
is
evident
silence
he
thundered
again
i
will
decide
the
time
we
will
not
kill
the
apache
dogs
but
can
we
help
it
if
they
die
for
want
of
food
or
drink
how
can
i
help
it
if
they
starve
before
i
free
them
rascal
i
cried
dog
speak
another
word
like
that
and
he
did
not
finish
his
threat
but
checked
himself
looking
me
in
the
face
which
could
not
have
been
pleasant
to
look
upon
i
completed
his
interrupted
sentence
and
ill
knock
you
down
with
my
fist
you
vilest
of
all
liars
he
sprang
back
drew
his
knife
growling
you
will
not
get
near
me
again
with
your
fist
if
you
come
one
step
towards
me
ill
stab
you
so
your
lightning
knife
said
and
tried
to
do
but
you
see
he
lies
there
i
will
consult
my
white
friends
as
to
what
shall
be
done
with
the
apaches
but
if
you
harm
a
hair
of
their
heads
you
are
lost
remember
i
can
blow
you
all
up
with
these
words
i
went
back
to
sam
who
could
not
hear
the
conversation
between
the
chief
and
me
because
of
the
howling
of
the
indians
he
sprang
to
meet
me
seized
both
my
hands
crying
welcome
my
dear
dear
boy
you
have
come
back
out
of
the
jaws
of
death
dick
will
see
here
what
do
you
think
of
this
tenderfoot
but
foolhardy
men
are
always
the
luckiest
and
the
worst
root
grows
the
biggest
potato
when
you
went
into
that
circle
my
heart
stood
still
i
could
not
breathe
and
my
thoughts
were
full
of
how
id
carry
out
this
tenderfoots
last
will
and
testament
but
a
thrust
a
stab
and
the
redskin
rolled
on
the
ground
now
weve
gained
our
end
and
the
apaches
are
free
youre
mistaken
there
i
said
mistaken
how
so
the
chief
made
a
mental
reservation
in
his
promise
which
now
comes
to
light
i
mistrusted
that
cried
sam
what
is
his
reservation
i
repeated
tanguas
words
to
him
and
he
was
so
angry
that
he
instantly
started
off
to
see
the
chief
i
resumed
the
clothing
and
weapons
i
had
laid
down
and
thought
over
the
situation
evidently
the
kiowas
had
been
confident
that
lightning
knife
would
kill
me
and
they
were
furious
over
the
result
of
our
encounter
they
could
not
fall
upon
us
since
it
was
a
lifeanddeath
fight
and
the
survivor
was
promised
security
but
they
would
find
some
excuse
for
a
quarrel
of
that
we
might
be
sure
the
chief
was
occupied
attending
to
the
body
of
the
dead
warrior
and
sam
found
him
in
no
mood
to
lend
an
ear
to
his
protests
he
strode
back
to
me
in
high
dudgeon
and
said
the
fellow
absolutely
refuses
to
keep
his
word
he
means
to
starve
the
prisoners
to
death
and
he
calls
that
not
killing
them
but
well
keep
our
eyes
open
and
get
a
shot
at
him
provided
we
dont
get
a
shot
that
is
a
boomerang
i
remarked
i
think
myself
wed
better
be
ready
to
protect
ourselves
for
our
life
may
be
in
danger
any
moment
lord
help
us
the
moments
come
he
cried
the
apaches
have
arrived
and
therell
be
a
lovely
row
get
ready
for
the
fight
gentlemen
over
beyond
where
the
prisoners
and
their
guards
were
rose
that
instant
the
shrill
hiiiiih
the
warcry
of
the
apaches
contrary
to
all
expectation
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
had
already
come
back
with
their
warriors
and
had
attacked
the
camp
of
the
kiowas
those
who
were
near
us
paused
in
amazement
and
then
the
chief
shouted
the
foe
among
our
brothers
quick
quick
and
help
them
he
would
have
rushed
back
but
sam
hawkins
cried
you
cant
go
dont
you
see
we
are
surrounded
do
you
suppose
the
apache
chiefs
are
such
fools
as
only
to
attack
your
guards
and
not
know
where
you
are
he
spoke
rapidly
but
before
he
had
quite
finished
the
awful
soulpiercing
cry
arose
around
us
we
were
standing
as
already
said
on
an
open
prairie
and
had
been
so
occupied
that
the
apaches
had
crawled
behind
the
bush
which
had
served
us
in
our
attack
on
tangua
and
had
surrounded
us
without
our
knowledge
and
now
sprang
upon
us
from
all
sides
in
overpowering
numbers
the
kiowas
shot
at
them
with
some
effect
but
not
enough
to
reckon
dont
kill
an
apache
not
one
i
shouted
to
our
three
scouts
for
already
the
deadly
battle
raged
around
us
the
head
engineer
and
the
three
surveyors
defended
themselves
and
were
cut
down
while
my
eyes
were
riveted
on
this
awful
sight
i
did
not
see
anything
that
went
on
around
me
we
were
attacked
by
a
considerable
band
and
separated
from
one
another
although
we
cried
out
to
the
apaches
that
we
were
their
friends
it
had
no
effect
they
flew
at
us
with
tomahawks
and
we
perforce
had
to
defend
ourselves
however
loath
to
do
so
with
our
guns
wielded
as
clubs
we
struck
down
so
many
that
we
won
a
little
breathingtime
for
ourselves
during
which
i
looked
about
me
sam
parker
and
stone
ran
towards
the
bushes
where
the
fight
was
still
hot
and
after
making
sure
that
the
surveyors
were
beyond
help
i
followed
i
had
scarcely
reached
the
bush
when
intschutschuna
himself
came
up
he
and
winnetou
had
been
with
that
band
of
apaches
which
had
captured
the
camp
and
freed
their
kinsmen
this
achieved
both
chiefs
had
run
to
the
assistance
of
the
main
body
which
we
had
encountered
intschutschuna
considerably
in
advance
of
his
son
as
he
bounded
around
the
bush
he
saw
me
and
exclaiming
landthief
raised
his
silverstudded
rifle
to
knock
me
down
i
cried
out
to
him
that
i
was
not
his
enemy
but
he
would
not
listen
only
redoubling
his
efforts
to
strike
me
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
if
i
would
not
be
overcome
perhaps
killed
i
must
disable
him
as
he
raised
his
arm
again
for
a
blow
i
threw
away
my
gun
with
which
i
had
parried
his
strokes
hung
on
his
neck
by
my
left
arm
and
with
my
right
fist
gave
him
a
blow
on
the
temple
his
rifle
dropped
he
staggered
and
fell
then
behind
me
a
joyful
voice
cried
that
is
intschutschuna
the
chief
of
the
apache
dogs
i
must
have
his
scalp
turning
around
i
saw
tangua
the
kiowa
chief
who
had
come
upon
the
scene
just
as
all
this
happened
he
dropped
his
gun
drew
his
knife
and
stooped
over
the
unconscious
apache
to
scalp
him
i
seized
his
arm
and
said
take
your
hands
off
i
have
conquered
him
he
is
mine
be
silent
white
vermin
he
snarled
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
the
chief
is
mine
get
out
or
he
finished
his
sentence
by
striking
at
me
with
his
knife
and
seizing
me
with
his
left
hand
i
did
not
want
to
stab
him
so
did
not
draw
my
own
knife
but
threw
myself
upon
him
and
tried
to
free
myself
from
his
grasp
failing
in
this
i
choked
him
till
he
could
not
move
and
then
bent
over
intschutschuna
whose
face
was
bleeding
from
my
knuckles
just
then
i
heard
a
rustle
behind
me
and
turned
to
see
whence
it
came
this
movement
saved
me
for
i
received
on
the
shoulder
a
violent
blow
which
had
been
intended
for
my
head
and
would
certainly
have
broken
it
it
came
from
winnetou
he
had
been
behind
his
father
as
i
have
said
before
and
coming
around
the
bush
he
saw
me
kneeling
over
the
chief
who
lay
bleeding
and
apparently
lifeless
and
he
promptly
gave
me
the
almost
fatal
blow
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
then
he
dropped
the
gun
drew
his
knife
and
fell
upon
me
my
position
was
as
bad
as
it
could
be
the
blow
had
shaken
my
whole
body
and
lamed
my
arm
i
tried
to
explain
to
winnetou
but
he
gave
me
no
chance
for
a
word
he
stabbed
me
and
the
point
of
the
knife
struck
the
edge
of
the
tin
box
in
which
i
carried
my
papers
glanced
up
through
my
neck
and
pierced
my
tongue
but
for
which
it
would
certainly
have
entered
my
heart
then
winnetou
withdrew
the
knife
and
held
it
ready
for
the
second
stroke
his
hand
at
my
throat
the
fear
of
death
doubled
my
strength
i
could
use
only
one
arm
and
hand
and
he
lay
across
me
sidewise
i
caught
his
right
hand
and
squeezed
it
till
he
dropped
the
knife
then
i
seized
his
left
arm
at
the
elbow
and
pulled
him
over
till
he
had
to
let
go
of
my
throat
then
i
lifted
his
knees
and
with
all
my
strength
pushed
myself
from
under
him
which
threw
the
upper
part
of
his
body
on
the
ground
the
next
moment
i
was
on
his
back
and
our
positions
were
reversed
the
question
now
was
how
to
hold
him
down
for
if
he
got
up
i
was
lost
setting
one
knee
on
his
thigh
and
one
on
his
arm
i
caught
him
around
the
neck
with
my
one
useful
arm
while
with
the
other
hand
he
was
feeling
for
his
knife
fortunately
in
vain
now
followed
an
awful
struggle
between
us
yet
could
i
have
spoken
one
word
would
have
sufficed
to
clear
up
the
situation
but
blood
flowed
in
streams
from
my
mouth
and
when
i
tried
to
speak
with
my
pierced
tongue
i
could
only
stammer
unintelligibly
winnetou
exerted
all
his
strength
to
throw
me
off
but
i
lay
on
him
like
a
mountain
not
to
be
gotten
rid
of
he
began
to
gasp
and
i
pressed
my
fingers
into
his
windpipe
so
tight
that
he
could
not
breathe
must
i
kill
him
not
in
any
case
i
freed
his
throat
for
a
moment
and
he
instantly
raised
his
head
which
gave
me
the
chance
i
wanted
one
two
three
good
blows
with
my
fist
in
quick
succession
and
winnetou
was
unconscious
i
had
conquered
winnetou
the
unconquered
i
drew
a
deep
deep
breath
as
well
as
i
could
and
not
draw
down
my
throat
the
blood
which
filled
my
mouth
and
streamed
as
fast
from
the
external
wound
as
i
tried
to
rise
i
heard
an
angry
howl
from
an
indian
behind
me
and
received
a
blow
on
the
head
which
knocked
me
senseless
when
i
came
to
myself
it
was
evening
so
long
had
i
lain
unconscious
everything
seemed
to
me
like
a
dream
i
felt
as
though
i
had
fallen
down
beside
the
wall
of
a
millwheel
which
could
not
turn
because
i
was
wedged
between
its
paddles
and
the
wall
the
water
rushed
over
me
and
the
force
which
should
have
turned
the
wheel
pressed
on
me
stronger
and
stronger
till
i
thought
that
i
should
be
crushed
all
my
limbs
were
in
pain
especially
my
head
and
one
shoulder
by
degrees
i
realized
that
the
mill
was
not
a
reality
but
delirium
and
the
roaring
and
rushing
was
not
water
but
the
result
of
the
blow
which
had
felled
me
and
the
pain
in
my
shoulder
was
not
caused
by
a
millwheel
crushing
me
but
by
the
blow
which
winnetou
had
given
me
the
blood
flowed
from
my
mouth
it
rushed
into
my
throat
and
choked
me
and
i
awoke
fully
to
myself
he
moves
oh
thank
god
he
moves
i
heard
sam
say
i
had
opened
my
eyes
but
what
i
saw
was
far
from
consoling
we
were
still
on
the
spot
where
the
fight
had
taken
place
over
twenty
campfires
were
burning
between
which
certainly
five
hundred
apaches
were
moving
about
many
were
wounded
and
a
large
number
lay
dead
on
two
sides
the
nearest
being
the
apaches
and
those
on
the
opposite
side
a
little
farther
away
the
kiowas
around
us
were
the
captive
kiowas
all
strongly
bound
not
one
had
escaped
and
tangua
the
chief
was
among
them
at
a
little
distance
apart
i
saw
a
man
lying
with
his
body
drawn
together
in
a
ring
for
the
evident
purpose
of
being
tortured
it
was
rattler
his
comrades
were
no
longer
alive
having
been
shot
at
once
but
he
as
the
murderer
of
klekipetrah
was
reserved
for
a
slow
and
agonizing
death
i
was
bound
hand
and
foot
as
were
parker
and
stone
who
lay
on
my
left
at
my
right
i
saw
sam
hawkins
who
was
fastened
by
his
feet
and
his
right
hand
was
bound
against
his
back
but
his
left
hand
was
free
as
i
learned
later
in
order
to
tend
me
thank
heaven
you
are
conscious
again
my
dear
jack
he
said
stroking
my
face
lovingly
with
his
free
hand
how
do
you
feel
do
you
want
anything
i
tried
to
answer
but
could
not
i
saw
sam
bending
over
me
with
anxious
eyes
but
i
heard
and
saw
no
more
for
again
i
sank
into
unconsciousness
upon
regaining
my
senses
i
felt
myself
in
motion
and
heard
the
tread
of
many
horses
feet
i
opened
my
eyes
i
was
lying
on
the
skin
of
the
grizzly
bear
i
had
killed
which
was
drawn
together
into
a
hammock
and
hung
between
two
horses
which
were
thus
bearing
me
somewhere
i
lay
so
deep
in
the
skin
that
i
could
see
only
the
heads
of
the
horses
and
the
sky
above
me
the
sun
shone
down
on
me
burning
like
molten
lead
and
swelling
my
veins
my
mouth
was
swollen
and
full
of
blood
i
tried
to
move
my
tongue
but
could
not
water
water
i
tried
to
say
for
i
was
consumed
with
thirst
but
i
could
only
utter
a
hoarse
groan
i
said
to
myself
that
it
was
all
over
with
me
and
tried
to
think
of
god
and
make
a
true
act
of
contrition
and
ask
the
mercy
i
was
so
soon
to
need
and
turn
my
eyes
to
the
land
on
the
shore
of
which
i
stood
but
again
weakness
overcame
me
this
time
i
fought
with
indians
buffaloes
and
bears
rode
for
lifeanddeath
over
scorching
plains
swam
for
months
over
shoreless
seasin
short
had
a
fever
caused
by
my
wounds
in
which
i
struggled
hard
and
long
with
death
occasionally
i
heard
sam
hawkins
voice
but
far
far
away
occasionally
too
i
saw
a
pair
of
dark
velvety
eyeswinnetous
eyes
then
i
died
was
laid
in
my
coffin
and
buried
i
heard
the
earth
shovelled
on
the
coffin
and
lay
in
the
ground
a
whole
unbroken
eternity
unable
to
move
till
the
lid
of
my
coffin
noiselessly
slid
off
and
disappeared
was
all
this
true
could
i
be
dead
i
raised
my
hand
to
my
forehead
andhallelujah
oh
thank
god
he
comes
back
from
death
he
is
alive
cried
sam
chapter
xiii
nursed
to
health
for
a
cruel
fate
as
i
opened
my
eyes
again
upon
this
world
i
saw
sam
hawkins
bending
over
me
his
face
radiant
with
joy
and
a
little
behind
him
were
dick
stone
and
will
parker
tears
of
happiness
in
their
honest
eyes
sam
took
both
my
hands
in
his
pushed
away
the
forest
of
beard
where
his
mouth
should
be
and
said
do
you
know
how
long
you
have
lain
here
i
answered
only
with
a
shake
of
the
head
three
weeks
three
whole
weeks
you
have
had
a
frightful
fever
and
became
rigidto
all
appearance
dead
the
apaches
would
have
buried
you
but
i
could
not
believe
you
were
gone
and
begged
so
hard
that
winnetou
spoke
to
his
father
who
allowed
you
to
remain
unburied
until
decomposition
should
set
in
i
have
to
thank
winnetou
for
that
i
must
call
him
i
closed
my
eyes
and
lay
still
no
longer
in
the
grave
but
in
a
blessed
languor
in
weary
content
only
wishing
to
lie
so
forever
and
ever
i
heard
a
step
a
hand
felt
me
over
and
moved
my
arm
then
i
heard
winnetous
voice
saying
is
not
sam
hawkins
mistaken
has
selkilata
old
shatterhand
really
revived
yes
yes
we
all
three
saw
it
he
answered
my
questions
by
movements
of
his
head
it
is
marvellous
but
it
were
better
he
had
not
come
back
for
he
has
returned
to
life
but
to
be
killed
but
he
is
the
apaches
best
friend
cried
sam
and
yet
he
knocked
me
down
twice
because
he
had
to
the
first
time
he
did
it
to
save
your
life
for
you
would
have
defended
yourself
and
the
kiowas
would
have
killed
you
and
the
second
time
he
had
to
defend
himself
from
you
we
tried
to
explain
but
your
braves
would
not
hear
us
hawkins
says
this
only
to
save
himself
no
it
is
the
truth
your
tongue
lieth
everything
you
have
said
to
escape
torture
convinces
us
that
you
were
even
a
greater
enemy
to
us
than
the
kiowa
dogs
you
spied
upon
us
and
betrayed
us
had
you
been
our
friend
you
would
have
warned
us
of
the
kiowas
coming
your
excuses
any
child
could
see
through
do
you
think
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
are
more
stupid
than
children
i
think
nothing
of
the
sort
old
shatterhand
is
unconscious
again
or
he
could
tell
you
that
i
have
spoken
the
truth
yes
he
would
lie
as
you
do
the
palefaces
are
all
liars
and
traitors
i
have
known
but
one
white
man
in
whom
truth
dwelt
and
that
was
klekipetrah
whom
you
murdered
i
was
almost
deceived
in
old
shatterhand
i
observed
his
daring
and
his
bodily
strength
and
wondered
at
it
uprightness
seemed
seated
in
his
eyes
and
i
thought
i
could
love
him
but
he
was
a
landthief
like
the
rest
he
did
not
prevent
you
from
entrapping
us
and
twice
he
knocked
me
in
the
head
with
his
fist
why
does
the
great
spirit
make
such
a
man
and
give
him
so
false
a
heart
i
wanted
to
look
at
him
as
he
spoke
but
my
muscles
would
not
obey
my
will
yet
as
i
heard
these
last
words
my
eyelids
lifted
and
i
saw
him
standing
before
me
clad
in
a
light
linen
garment
and
unarmed
he
has
opened
his
eyes
again
cried
sam
and
winnetou
bent
over
me
looking
long
and
steadily
into
my
eyes
at
last
he
said
can
you
speak
i
shook
my
head
have
you
any
pain
i
made
the
same
reply
be
honest
with
me
when
a
man
comes
back
from
death
he
surely
must
speak
the
truth
did
you
four
men
really
want
to
free
us
i
nodded
twice
he
waved
his
hand
contemptuously
and
cried
excitedly
lies
lies
lies
even
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
he
lies
had
you
told
the
truth
i
might
have
thought
that
at
least
you
could
improve
and
ask
my
father
to
spare
you
but
youre
not
worth
such
intercession
and
must
die
we
will
nurse
you
carefully
that
you
may
be
sound
and
strong
to
bear
long
torture
a
weak
or
sick
man
would
die
quickly
and
that
is
no
punishment
i
could
not
hold
my
eyes
open
any
longer
oh
if
i
could
but
speak
the
crafty
little
sam
hawkins
did
not
put
our
case
very
convincingly
i
would
have
spoken
differently
as
i
was
feebly
thinking
this
sam
said
to
the
young
apache
chief
we
have
told
you
clearly
what
our
part
was
in
this
affair
your
braves
would
have
been
tortured
but
old
shatterhand
prevented
it
by
fighting
metanakva
and
conquering
him
he
risked
his
life
for
you
and
as
a
reward
he
is
to
be
tortured
you
have
proved
nothing
to
me
and
the
whole
story
is
a
lie
ask
tangua
the
chief
he
is
in
your
hands
i
have
asked
him
and
he
says
you
lie
old
shatterhand
did
not
kill
metanakva
he
was
slain
by
our
warriors
in
the
attack
that
is
outrageous
tangua
knows
we
befriended
you
and
got
the
best
of
him
and
now
he
wants
to
be
revenged
he
has
sworn
by
the
great
spirit
and
i
believe
him
not
you
i
say
to
you
as
i
have
just
said
to
old
shatterhand
if
you
had
been
honest
with
me
i
might
have
pleaded
for
you
klekipetrah
who
was
our
father
friend
and
teacher
showed
me
the
beauty
of
peace
and
gentleness
i
do
not
seek
blood
and
my
father
the
chief
does
as
i
desire
therefore
we
have
not
killed
one
of
the
kiowas
whom
we
captured
and
they
will
pay
us
for
the
wrong
done
us
not
with
their
lives
but
with
horses
weapons
skins
and
vessels
rattler
is
klekipetrahs
murderer
and
must
die
sam
answered
this
the
longest
speech
i
had
heard
from
the
silent
winnetou
very
briefly
we
cant
say
we
were
your
enemies
when
we
are
your
friends
silence
said
winnetou
sternly
i
see
that
you
will
die
with
this
lie
on
your
lips
we
have
allowed
you
more
liberty
than
the
other
prisoners
that
you
might
attend
old
shatterhand
you
are
not
worth
such
consideration
and
henceforth
you
shall
be
more
restrained
the
sick
man
needs
you
no
longer
and
you
must
come
with
me
dont
say
that
dont
say
that
winnetou
cried
sam
in
horror
i
cant
leave
old
shatterhand
you
must
if
i
command
it
said
the
young
chief
i
will
not
hear
a
word
will
you
come
with
me
or
shall
my
braves
bind
you
and
take
you
away
we
are
in
your
power
and
must
obey
when
shall
we
see
old
shatterhand
again
on
the
day
of
his
death
and
yours
not
before
no
then
let
us
say
goodby
now
before
we
follow
you
he
grasped
my
hands
and
i
felt
his
beard
on
my
face
as
he
kissed
my
brow
stone
and
parker
did
the
same
and
then
they
went
away
with
winnetou
i
lay
a
long
time
alone
till
the
apaches
came
and
carried
me
i
knew
not
where
for
i
was
too
weak
to
see
and
then
i
was
left
alone
again
and
slept
when
i
awoke
i
could
open
my
eyes
and
move
my
tongue
a
little
and
was
far
less
weak
than
before
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
i
lay
in
the
furthest
corner
of
a
large
square
room
built
of
stone
which
received
its
light
from
an
opening
on
one
side
which
served
as
door
the
skins
of
grizzly
bears
had
been
piled
on
top
of
one
another
to
make
a
comfortable
bed
and
i
was
covered
with
a
beautifully
embroidered
indian
blanket
in
the
corner
by
the
door
sat
two
indian
women
one
old
the
other
young
like
all
indian
women
after
they
are
past
their
youth
the
former
was
ugly
bent
and
seamed
by
the
hard
work
that
falls
on
the
squaws
when
the
braves
are
on
the
warpath
or
hunting
but
the
younger
was
very
beautiful
so
much
so
that
she
would
have
attracted
attention
in
any
civilized
society
she
wore
a
long
light
blue
garment
gathered
about
the
neck
and
held
around
the
waist
by
a
girdle
of
rattlesnakeskin
her
only
ornament
was
her
long
splendid
hair
which
fell
below
her
hips
in
two
heavy
black
braids
it
resembled
winnetous
and
the
girl
looked
like
him
she
had
the
same
velvety
black
eyes
which
were
half
concealed
by
long
dark
lashes
and
there
was
no
trace
in
her
nor
in
him
of
the
high
cheekbones
of
the
indian
her
soft
oval
cheeks
curved
into
a
chin
with
a
mischievous
dimple
she
spoke
softly
to
the
old
woman
not
to
awaken
me
and
as
her
pretty
red
lips
parted
in
a
laugh
her
even
white
teeth
flashed
between
them
her
delicate
nose
was
rather
of
grecian
than
of
indian
type
and
her
skin
was
a
light
copper
bronze
with
a
silvery
tint
this
maiden
looked
about
eighteen
years
old
and
was
i
felt
sure
the
sister
of
winnetou
i
moved
and
the
maiden
looked
up
from
her
work
rose
and
came
over
to
me
you
are
awake
she
said
in
perfectly
good
english
to
my
surprise
is
there
anything
you
would
like
i
opened
my
mouth
but
closed
it
again
realizing
that
i
could
not
speak
however
i
had
been
able
to
move
by
an
effort
perhaps
i
could
speak
if
i
tried
i
made
a
great
effort
and
said
yesiwantmuch
i
was
delighted
to
hear
my
own
voice
after
more
than
three
weeks
silence
though
the
words
came
indistinctly
and
painfully
speak
slowly
or
by
signs
said
the
young
girl
nschotschi
sees
that
speech
is
painful
to
you
is
nschotschi
your
name
yes
it
is
fitting
you
are
like
a
lovely
spring
day
when
the
first
sweetest
flowers
of
the
year
are
blooming
nschotschi
means
fair
day
and
she
blushed
a
little
at
my
compliment
tell
me
what
you
desire
she
said
tell
me
first
why
you
are
here
my
brother
winnetou
commanded
me
to
nurse
you
you
are
very
like
that
brave
young
warrior
you
wanted
to
kill
him
these
words
were
said
half
as
a
question
half
as
a
statement
while
she
looked
searchingly
into
my
eyes
as
if
she
would
read
my
very
soul
never
i
said
emphatically
he
does
not
believe
that
and
considers
you
his
enemy
you
have
twice
struck
down
him
whom
no
one
has
conquered
once
to
save
his
life
once
to
save
my
own
i
loved
him
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
him
again
she
looked
long
at
me
then
she
said
he
does
not
believe
you
and
i
am
his
sister
does
your
mouth
pain
not
now
can
you
swallow
i
can
try
will
you
give
me
a
drink
of
water
yes
and
some
to
bathe
in
we
will
bring
it
to
you
she
went
away
with
the
old
woman
leaving
me
to
wonder
why
winnetou
who
considered
me
his
enemy
and
utterly
refused
to
credit
any
assurance
to
the
contrary
should
send
me
his
own
sister
as
nurse
after
a
time
fair
day
came
back
with
the
older
woman
the
former
carried
a
vessel
of
brown
clay
such
as
the
pueblo
indians
use
filled
with
fresh
water
she
thought
me
still
too
weak
to
drink
without
assistance
and
held
it
to
my
lips
herself
it
was
dreadfully
painful
to
me
to
swallow
but
it
must
be
done
i
drank
in
little
mouthfuls
and
with
long
rests
between
until
the
vessel
was
quite
empty
how
it
refreshed
me
nschotschi
saw
it
and
said
that
has
done
you
good
by
and
by
i
will
bring
you
something
else
for
you
must
be
hungry
too
now
will
you
bathe
the
old
woman
brought
me
a
gourd
of
water
and
set
it
before
me
with
a
towel
of
fine
white
flax
i
tried
to
use
them
but
was
too
weak
my
fair
young
nurse
dipped
the
cloth
in
the
water
and
bathed
the
face
and
hands
of
the
supposed
enemy
of
her
father
and
brother
when
she
had
finished
she
asked
me
with
a
soft
little
pitying
laugh
were
you
always
so
thin
i
felt
my
cheeks
and
said
i
was
never
thin
look
at
yourself
in
the
water
i
looked
into
the
gourd
and
shrank
back
shocked
for
the
head
of
a
skeleton
seemed
to
look
up
at
me
what
a
miracle
that
i
am
alive
i
cried
so
winnetou
says
you
have
even
borne
the
long
ride
here
the
great
spirit
has
given
you
an
extraordinarily
strong
body
for
few
others
thus
wounded
could
have
endured
a
journey
of
five
days
five
days
where
are
we
in
our
pueblo
at
rio
pecos
and
are
the
kiowas
here
too
yes
they
really
ought
to
die
any
other
tribe
would
torture
them
but
the
good
klekipetrah
taught
us
to
be
merciful
so
they
are
to
pay
a
ransom
and
go
home
and
my
three
comrades
they
are
bound
and
are
in
a
room
like
this
they
are
well
cared
for
because
he
who
is
to
die
by
torture
must
be
strong
to
endure
or
it
is
no
punishment
and
are
they
really
to
die
yes
and
i
you
too
will
winnetou
come
to
me
no
but
i
have
something
important
to
say
to
him
he
will
not
hear
it
yet
if
you
will
tell
me
what
it
is
perhaps
he
will
let
me
tell
him
about
it
no
thank
you
i
could
tell
you
perfectly
well
but
if
he
is
too
proud
to
come
to
me
i
have
a
pride
of
my
own
and
will
send
him
no
messages
you
will
not
see
him
till
the
day
of
your
death
we
will
leave
you
now
if
you
need
anything
call
us
we
shall
hear
and
will
come
to
you
she
gave
me
a
little
willow
whistle
and
then
went
away
with
the
old
squaw
my
young
nurse
attended
me
faithfully
every
day
fed
me
savory
broths
and
porridges
from
a
wooden
spoon
kneeling
at
my
bedside
and
nourishing
me
like
a
helpless
child
day
by
day
i
grew
stronger
under
this
care
though
for
a
long
time
it
hurt
me
dreadfully
to
eat
i
tried
to
keep
down
all
expression
of
pain
but
in
spite
of
myself
the
water
would
stand
in
my
eyes
when
i
swallowed
nschotschi
saw
this
and
indianlike
admired
silent
endurance
of
pain
it
is
a
pity
she
said
suddenly
one
day
that
you
were
born
a
lying
paleface
and
not
an
apache
i
do
not
lie
i
never
lie
as
you
will
learn
later
i
should
be
glad
to
think
so
but
klekipetrah
was
the
only
paleface
in
whom
truth
dwelt
you
murdered
him
and
must
die
and
be
buried
with
him
i
felt
sure
that
i
should
not
die
for
i
had
incontrovertible
proof
of
our
innocence
in
the
lock
of
hair
which
i
had
cut
from
winnetous
head
when
i
freed
him
but
had
i
it
still
had
it
not
been
taken
from
me
i
searched
my
pockets
and
found
everything
as
i
had
left
it
nothing
had
been
taken
from
me
but
my
weapons
i
took
out
my
box
of
papers
and
found
winnetous
hair
safely
folded
between
them
i
laid
it
back
with
a
happy
heart
possessing
this
i
had
no
fear
of
dying
i
smiled
at
the
beautiful
indian
girl
quite
cheerfully
and
said
the
sweet
fair
day
will
see
that
i
shall
live
on
many
days
she
shook
her
head
you
are
condemned
by
a
council
of
the
elders
she
said
they
will
decide
otherwise
when
they
hear
that
i
am
innocent
they
will
not
believe
it
they
must
for
i
can
prove
it
oh
prove
it
prove
it
she
cried
nschotschi
would
be
glad
indeed
if
she
could
know
you
were
no
liar
and
traitor
tell
me
your
proof
or
give
it
to
me
and
let
me
take
it
to
winnetou
let
him
come
to
me
to
learn
what
it
is
he
will
not
do
that
nor
will
i
send
to
him
i
am
not
accustomed
to
sue
for
friendship
nor
send
messengers
to
one
who
can
come
to
me
how
unrelenting
you
warriors
are
i
should
have
been
so
glad
to
have
brought
you
winnetous
forgiveness
i
do
not
need
to
be
forgiven
for
i
have
done
no
wrong
but
i
would
ask
a
favor
of
you
in
case
you
see
sam
hawkins
tell
him
to
feel
no
anxiety
for
as
soon
as
i
am
well
we
shall
be
free
again
do
not
think
that
this
hope
will
never
be
fulfilled
it
is
not
hope
but
certainty
later
on
fair
day
will
tell
me
i
was
right
the
tone
in
which
i
spoke
was
so
confident
that
she
gave
up
contradicting
me
and
went
away
without
another
word
i
improved
steadily
the
skeleton
took
on
the
flesh
and
muscles
of
a
living
man
and
the
wound
in
my
mouth
healed
nschotschi
remained
always
the
same
kindly
careful
yet
sure
that
death
was
daily
drawing
nearer
me
i
noticed
after
a
while
that
when
she
thought
herself
unobserved
her
eyes
rested
on
me
with
a
sorrowful
questioning
look
she
seemed
to
be
beginning
to
pity
me
i
had
thought
her
heartless
but
had
wronged
her
at
last
one
beautiful
sunny
morning
in
late
autumn
nschotschi
brought
my
breakfast
and
sat
beside
me
instead
of
keeping
at
a
distance
as
she
had
done
since
i
was
able
to
move
about
and
had
almost
completely
regained
my
strength
her
eyes
were
moist
and
rested
on
me
tenderly
and
at
last
two
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
you
are
crying
i
said
what
has
happened
the
kiowas
are
going
home
their
ransom
has
come
and
now
they
go
and
that
grieves
you
so
you
must
have
indeed
become
good
friends
you
do
not
know
of
what
you
speak
nor
suspect
what
lies
before
you
the
farewell
of
the
kiowas
is
to
be
celebrated
by
your
torture
and
that
of
your
three
white
brothers
i
had
been
expecting
this
and
did
not
shrink
as
i
heard
it
i
ate
my
breakfast
quietly
wondering
what
would
happen
before
the
sun
went
downpossibly
in
spite
of
my
fancied
security
the
last
sun
i
should
look
upon
i
gave
the
dish
back
to
fair
day
who
took
it
no
longer
able
to
keep
back
her
tears
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
speak
to
you
she
said
farewell
you
are
called
old
shatterhand
and
are
a
strong
warrior
be
strong
when
they
torture
you
nschotschi
is
sore
distressed
by
your
death
but
she
will
rejoice
if
you
show
no
signs
of
pain
and
lock
your
groans
in
your
own
breast
give
me
this
happiness
and
die
like
a
hero
with
this
prayer
she
went
away
and
i
watched
her
through
the
open
door
then
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
and
waited
long
anxious
hours
till
midday
at
last
i
heard
the
tramp
of
many
feet
and
winnetou
entered
followed
by
five
apaches
he
looked
at
me
long
and
searchingly
do
you
remember
when
you
were
to
see
me
again
he
asked
on
the
day
of
my
death
you
have
said
it
that
day
has
come
rise
you
must
be
bound
it
would
have
been
madness
to
attempt
resistance
for
there
were
six
indians
against
me
i
rose
and
they
tied
my
hands
together
then
two
thongs
were
put
around
my
ankles
so
that
i
could
take
short
steps
but
could
not
jump
or
run
i
was
then
led
out
to
the
platform
which
ran
around
the
pueblo
house
and
from
which
a
ladder
led
to
the
ground
we
descended
slowly
from
round
to
round
three
indians
ahead
three
behind
i
in
the
middle
on
every
platform
stood
women
and
children
who
gazed
at
me
in
silence
and
then
came
down
and
fell
in
behind
us
all
the
indians
of
the
village
numbering
several
hundred
were
gathering
to
see
us
die
chapter
xiv
on
trial
for
life
the
procession
which
was
escorting
me
to
torture
passed
on
in
silence
its
numbers
augmenting
as
we
went
i
saw
that
the
pueblo
lay
in
a
hollow
at
one
side
of
the
broad
valley
of
the
rio
pecos
into
which
we
turned
the
indians
formed
a
halfcircle
inside
of
which
next
the
children
sat
the
women
and
maidens
among
whom
i
saw
nschotschi
whose
eyes
rarely
wandered
from
my
face
through
the
following
trial
my
three
comrades
were
already
on
the
scene
when
i
arrived
and
showed
that
they
had
been
well
cared
for
during
our
imprisonment
the
expression
of
faithful
loving
old
sams
face
was
divided
between
irrepressible
joy
at
seeing
me
again
and
sorrow
at
the
horrible
circumstances
in
which
we
met
to
part
forever
ah
my
dear
boy
he
cried
here
you
come
too
its
a
dreadful
very
dreadful
operation
were
to
undergo
i
dont
believe
we
can
stand
it
very
few
live
through
the
torture
but
if
we
do
i
imagine
were
to
be
burned
have
you
no
hope
of
deliverance
sam
i
dont
see
where
its
to
come
from
i
have
been
racking
my
brains
for
a
week
but
i
havent
found
the
least
suggestion
weve
been
stuck
in
a
dark
stone
hole
of
a
room
tied
fast
and
well
guardedno
earthly
chance
to
get
away
how
have
you
fared
very
well
i
believe
it
youve
been
fattened
like
a
martinmas
goose
and
for
the
same
reason
no
i
see
no
deliverance
for
us
and
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
die
bravely
you
may
believe
me
or
not
but
i
feel
neither
fear
nor
anxiety
though
i
know
by
night
there
will
be
nothing
left
of
us
on
earth
but
four
little
handfuls
of
ashes
possibly
but
i
havent
lost
hope
i
believe
that
at
the
end
of
this
threatening
day
we
shall
find
ourselves
all
right
is
there
any
foundation
for
your
hope
yes
a
lock
of
hair
a
lock
of
hair
he
repeated
in
amazement
hair
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
has
some
lovely
maiden
in
the
east
sent
you
her
locks
to
present
to
the
apaches
no
this
is
a
mans
hair
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
doubted
my
sanity
shook
his
head
and
said
my
dear
young
friend
youre
really
not
right
in
your
head
your
wound
has
knocked
something
out
of
place
there
for
i
must
say
i
do
not
see
how
a
lock
of
hair
can
save
us
from
torture
no
but
you
will
see
well
be
free
before
the
torture
begins
no
one
prevented
our
talking
together
winnetou
and
his
father
and
tangua
were
discussing
something
with
the
apaches
who
had
brought
me
hither
and
paid
no
attention
to
us
but
now
intschutschuna
turned
around
and
said
in
a
voice
plainly
audible
to
all
my
red
brothers
sisters
and
children
and
also
the
braves
of
the
kiowa
tribe
hear
me
he
paused
till
he
saw
that
he
had
every
ones
attention
and
then
continued
the
palefaces
are
the
enemies
of
the
red
man
and
only
seldom
is
there
one
whose
eyes
look
upon
us
in
friendship
the
noblest
of
these
few
good
white
men
came
to
the
apaches
to
be
their
friend
and
father
therefore
we
gave
him
the
name
of
klekipetrah
white
father
my
brothers
and
sisters
all
knew
and
loved
him
let
them
proclaim
it
how
arose
as
with
one
voice
from
the
entire
circle
then
the
chief
continued
in
a
long
and
impressive
speech
to
set
forth
the
story
of
klekipetrahs
murder
and
the
attempt
of
the
white
men
to
build
a
railroad
through
the
indians
lands
it
was
a
speech
establishing
our
guilt
and
pointing
to
our
death
and
was
interrupted
at
intervals
by
the
acclaiming
chorus
of
how
from
the
tribe
at
the
hands
of
any
other
indians
intschutschuna
said
who
knew
what
we
know
of
these
men
they
would
be
given
over
to
torture
at
once
but
we
will
be
obedient
to
the
teaching
of
our
white
father
and
be
a
just
judge
we
will
not
condemn
our
enemies
unheard
but
they
shall
be
convicted
out
of
their
own
mouths
you
have
heard
he
continued
turning
to
sam
what
i
have
said
you
shall
tell
us
the
truth
answer
the
questions
i
will
put
to
you
you
were
with
the
white
men
who
measured
for
the
road
of
the
firesteed
yes
but
we
three
did
not
measure
your
land
we
were
there
only
to
protect
those
who
did
and
as
to
the
fourth
who
is
called
old
shatter
silence
the
chief
interrupted
you
shall
only
answer
my
questions
and
speak
no
further
you
belong
to
these
palefaces
answer
yes
or
no
yes
and
old
shatterhand
measured
with
them
yes
replied
sam
reluctantly
and
you
protected
these
people
yes
then
are
you
more
guilty
than
they
for
he
who
protects
a
thief
deserves
double
punishment
rattler
the
murderer
was
your
companion
yes
but
he
was
no
friend
of
ours
he
silence
dog
you
are
only
to
tell
me
what
i
wish
to
know
if
you
speak
beyond
your
brief
answer
you
shall
be
whipped
you
delivered
us
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
the
kiowas
no
that
is
a
lie
it
is
the
truth
did
you
not
spend
a
whole
night
spying
on
us
is
that
true
or
false
it
is
true
and
you
led
the
palefaces
to
the
water
to
entrap
us
and
hid
the
kiowas
in
the
woods
where
they
could
fall
upon
us
yes
i
did
but
silence
i
want
short
answers
and
no
long
speech
that
night
and
the
next
day
we
lost
sixteen
warriors
and
they
putting
aside
the
blood
and
suffering
of
the
wounded
must
be
avenged
you
must
die
you
have
no
claim
to
pity
or
mercy
we
dont
want
mercy
we
want
justice
sam
interrupted
will
you
be
silent
dog
thundered
the
chief
i
am
through
with
you
but
since
you
speak
of
justice
tangua
the
kiowa
chief
may
testify
are
these
palefaces
our
friends
no
said
the
kiowa
evidently
rejoicing
that
things
were
going
so
badly
for
us
no
they
begged
me
to
kill
you
to
kill
you
all
this
was
too
much
for
me
i
broke
the
silence
around
us
crying
that
is
such
a
shameless
lie
that
i
would
knock
you
down
if
my
hands
were
free
dog
he
shrieked
i
will
knock
you
down
he
raised
his
fist
but
i
said
strike
if
you
are
not
ashamed
to
strike
a
man
who
cannot
defend
himself
you
have
been
talking
here
of
justice
and
letting
us
testify
is
that
justice
when
a
man
can
only
say
what
you
have
made
up
your
mind
he
shall
say
how
can
we
testify
if
we
are
to
be
whipped
for
speaking
one
word
more
than
you
want
to
hear
intschutschuna
is
an
unjust
judge
he
puts
the
questions
so
that
our
answers
must
prove
us
guilty
allowing
us
to
give
no
other
and
when
we
would
speak
the
truth
which
would
deliver
us
prevents
us
with
abuse
we
dont
care
for
such
justice
wed
rather
you
began
the
torture
you
wont
hear
a
sigh
from
us
uff
uff
i
heard
a
womans
voice
cry
and
knew
it
was
winnetous
sister
uff
uff
cried
many
apaches
round
her
for
courage
is
what
indians
most
respect
and
they
praise
it
even
in
an
enemy
i
continued
when
i
first
saw
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
i
said
to
myself
they
were
brave
men
and
just
ones
whom
i
could
love
and
honor
but
i
was
mistaken
they
are
no
better
than
others
for
they
listen
to
the
voice
of
a
liar
and
will
not
hear
a
word
of
truth
sam
hawkins
has
allowed
himself
to
be
silenced
but
i
do
not
care
for
your
threats
and
despise
a
man
who
oppresses
a
prisoner
only
because
he
is
helpless
if
i
were
free
id
talk
to
you
differently
dog
you
dare
to
call
me
a
liar
cried
tangua
ill
break
your
bones
he
raised
his
gun
to
strike
me
but
winnetou
sprang
forward
caught
it
and
cried
the
kiowa
chief
must
be
quiet
old
shatterhand
has
spoken
boldly
but
i
agree
with
him
intschutschuna
my
father
the
chief
of
all
the
apaches
may
allow
him
to
say
all
that
he
has
to
say
tangua
had
to
obey
and
intschutschuna
granted
his
sons
request
he
came
near
me
and
said
old
shatterhand
is
like
a
bird
of
prey
that
still
rends
though
he
is
caged
did
you
not
knock
winnetou
down
twice
have
you
not
even
struck
me
with
your
fist
did
i
do
it
willingly
did
you
not
force
me
to
it
i
demanded
forced
you
he
repeated
amazed
certainly
your
warriors
would
not
listen
to
a
word
from
us
they
attacked
us
so
fiercely
that
we
had
to
defend
ourselves
but
ask
them
if
we
wounded
them
though
we
might
have
killed
them
then
when
you
came
up
and
attacked
me
you
would
not
listen
to
me
either
i
had
to
defend
myself
and
i
might
have
shot
or
stabbed
you
but
i
knocked
you
down
because
i
was
your
friend
and
would
not
do
you
real
harm
then
came
tangua
the
kiowa
chief
and
wanted
to
take
your
scalp
and
because
i
would
not
let
him
he
attacked
me
and
i
conquered
him
then
this
miserable
coyote
lies
as
if
he
had
a
hundred
tongues
cried
tangua
are
they
really
lies
asked
winnetou
yes
i
hope
my
young
brother
winnetou
does
not
doubt
my
word
i
begin
to
you
lay
senseless
like
my
father
when
i
came
that
agrees
with
his
story
let
old
shatterhand
continue
i
had
fought
tangua
i
resumed
to
save
intschutschuna
when
winnetou
came
up
i
did
not
see
him
and
he
gave
me
a
blow
with
his
gun
fortunately
not
on
the
head
but
on
the
shoulder
he
then
wounded
me
through
the
tongue
and
i
could
not
speak
or
i
would
have
told
him
that
i
would
be
his
friend
and
brother
for
i
loved
him
i
was
badly
hurt
and
my
arm
lamed
but
i
fought
him
and
he
lay
unconscious
before
me
like
tangua
and
intschutschuna
i
could
have
killed
both
the
apache
chiefs
did
i
do
so
you
would
have
done
so
but
an
apache
came
up
and
struck
you
down
with
a
tomahawk
answered
intschutschuna
i
admit
there
is
something
in
your
words
that
almost
awakens
faith
in
them
but
when
you
first
knocked
down
my
son
winnetou
you
were
not
forced
to
do
so
indeed
i
was
we
wanted
to
save
you
and
him
you
are
brave
men
and
would
have
defended
yourselves
from
the
kiowas
and
you
would
have
been
wounded
or
killed
we
wanted
to
prevent
this
so
i
knocked
winnetou
down
and
you
were
overpowered
by
my
friends
lies
nothing
but
lies
cried
tangua
i
came
up
as
he
knocked
you
down
it
was
he
not
i
that
would
have
taken
your
scalp
i
would
have
stopped
him
but
he
struck
me
with
that
hand
in
which
a
great
wicked
spirit
dwells
and
nothing
can
stand
against
it
i
turned
on
him
and
said
threateningly
i
spared
you
because
i
want
to
shed
no
mans
blood
but
if
ever
i
fight
you
again
it
will
be
with
weapons
and
not
my
fist
and
you
shall
not
get
off
so
easily
mark
that
you
fight
me
he
jeered
we
will
burn
you
and
scatter
your
ashes
to
the
four
winds
i
think
not
i
shall
be
free
sooner
than
you
think
and
demand
a
reckoning
from
you
you
shall
have
it
i
promise
you
and
i
wish
your
words
might
be
fulfilled
that
i
might
crush
you
intschutschuna
put
an
end
to
this
little
interlude
by
saying
to
me
old
shatterhand
is
very
bold
if
he
thinks
to
be
free
he
has
only
made
statements
but
has
not
proved
them
have
you
anything
more
to
say
perhaps
later
not
now
say
it
now
for
later
you
can
say
nothing
i
will
be
silent
now
for
i
want
to
see
what
you
decide
in
regard
to
us
if
i
speak
later
you
will
see
that
old
shatterhand
is
not
a
man
whose
word
is
to
be
despised
intschutschuna
turned
from
us
and
nodded
to
certain
old
warriors
who
left
the
circle
and
gathered
around
him
for
consultation
while
tangua
of
course
used
every
effort
to
turn
the
decision
as
he
wished
the
conference
lasted
but
a
short
time
the
old
braves
came
back
to
their
places
in
the
circle
and
intschutschuna
announced
in
a
loud
voice
hear
ye
warriors
of
the
apaches
and
kiowas
what
has
been
determined
for
these
four
palefaces
bound
here
it
had
been
previously
decided
in
a
council
of
the
elders
that
we
should
drive
them
into
the
water
and
let
them
fight
each
other
and
finally
we
would
burn
them
but
old
shatterhand
the
youngest
of
them
has
spoken
words
which
have
found
favor
with
the
wisdom
of
the
elders
they
deserve
death
but
it
seems
they
intended
less
wickedness
than
we
believed
so
we
have
withdrawn
our
first
sentence
and
will
let
the
great
spirit
decide
between
us
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
sam
said
to
me
gracious
this
is
interesting
very
much
so
do
you
know
what
he
means
i
suppose
a
duel
an
appeal
to
arms
dont
you
think
so
yes
but
between
whom
the
chief
continuing
answered
sams
question
the
paleface
called
old
shatterhand
seems
to
be
the
foremost
of
them
so
the
decision
shall
be
entrusted
to
him
he
shall
be
opposed
by
the
one
on
our
side
whose
rank
is
highest
this
is
i
intschutschuna
the
chief
of
the
apaches
the
mischief
he
and
you
whispered
sam
in
the
greatest
amazement
uff
uff
uff
echoed
through
the
apache
ranks
for
they
too
wondered
that
he
should
fight
with
me
when
he
could
so
easily
have
appointed
another
to
the
task
but
his
next
words
explained
the
reason
for
this
the
honor
of
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
has
been
sorely
injured
continued
the
chief
they
having
been
knocked
down
by
the
fist
of
this
paleface
they
must
wipe
out
this
stain
by
fighting
him
winnetou
must
give
way
to
me
for
i
am
older
and
to
me
belongs
the
right
of
killing
old
shatterhand
you
may
be
glad
whispered
sam
for
your
death
will
be
quicker
than
ours
intschutschuna
spoke
again
we
will
unbind
old
shatterhand
and
he
shall
go
into
the
river
to
swim
across
it
but
he
shall
take
no
weapon
i
will
follow
him
with
a
tomahawk
if
old
shatterhand
can
get
across
and
reach
that
cedar
standing
there
in
the
plain
he
is
saved
and
his
comrades
are
free
they
can
go
where
they
will
but
if
i
kill
him
before
he
reaches
the
cedar
they
too
must
die
but
not
by
torture
they
shall
be
shot
let
all
the
braves
signify
that
they
hear
my
words
and
agree
with
them
how
rose
the
answer
in
concert
it
may
be
imagined
how
excited
they
were
at
this
announcement
sam
dick
and
will
more
than
i
these
fellows
have
chosen
badly
because
you
are
our
superior
it
doesnt
follow
that
you
know
how
to
swim
what
nonsense
their
real
reason
is
that
youre
a
tenderfoot
i
should
have
taken
this
id
have
shown
him
that
sam
hawkins
can
go
through
the
water
like
a
trout
but
you
consider
my
dear
young
friend
that
not
only
your
life
but
our
lives
hang
on
this
if
you
fail
i
can
never
speak
another
word
to
you
dont
worry
my
dear
sam
ill
do
what
i
can
i
dont
think
for
a
moment
the
indians
have
any
underhand
reason
for
choosing
me
i
am
sure
too
i
can
save
you
more
easily
than
you
could
have
saved
us
well
i
hope
so
and
its
for
life
or
death
you
mustnt
spare
intschutschuna
never
think
of
doing
that
well
see
thats
no
answer
theres
nothing
to
see
if
you
spare
him
youre
lost
and
we
with
you
these
redskins
can
throw
a
tomahawk
a
hundred
feet
away
and
cut
off
your
fingers
youll
get
it
in
the
back
or
head
before
you
can
get
over
no
matter
how
well
you
swim
i
know
my
dear
sam
and
i
know
too
that
a
thimbleful
of
wit
is
worth
more
than
a
barrelfull
of
mere
strength
wit
what
good
is
that
against
a
wellaimed
tomahawk
it
helps
sam
it
helps
and
i
have
a
plan
remember
this
if
i
drown
we
are
saved
i
said
this
hastily
for
the
three
chiefs
now
came
over
to
us
intschutschuna
said
we
will
now
free
old
shatterhand
but
he
need
not
think
he
can
escape
for
more
than
a
hundred
will
follow
him
to
the
waters
edge
it
would
never
occur
to
me
i
said
for
if
i
could
get
away
it
would
be
disgraceful
to
desert
my
comrades
i
was
liberated
and
moved
my
arm
to
test
its
powers
then
i
said
it
is
a
great
honor
for
me
to
contest
with
the
chief
of
the
apaches
but
it
is
not
an
honor
for
him
why
not
because
i
am
no
adversary
for
him
i
have
bathed
of
course
but
i
would
not
dare
cross
such
a
broad
deep
river
as
that
is
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
winnetou
and
i
are
the
best
swimmers
of
the
tribe
and
it
is
no
victory
for
us
to
conquer
a
poor
swimmer
and
you
are
armed
while
i
am
not
i
go
then
to
my
death
and
my
comrades
must
also
die
when
will
you
strike
me
with
the
tomahawk
when
it
pleases
me
he
said
with
the
contemptuous
smile
of
a
virtuoso
to
an
amateur
it
may
be
done
in
the
water
yes
i
tried
to
appear
more
anxious
and
cast
down
than
ever
and
can
i
kill
you
i
asked
meekly
he
gave
me
a
look
which
said
plainly
poor
worm
theres
no
question
of
that
but
he
said
it
is
a
contest
for
life
or
death
you
may
kill
me
but
in
case
such
a
thing
happens
you
must
still
reach
the
cedar
and
i
shall
not
be
held
guilty
of
your
death
no
if
i
kill
you
your
comrades
must
die
but
if
you
kill
me
and
then
get
to
the
cedar
you
are
free
come
he
turned
away
and
i
pulled
off
my
coat
and
vest
sam
cried
out
to
me
in
anguish
if
you
could
see
your
face
and
hear
the
mournful
tone
of
your
voice
i
am
in
deadly
fear
for
you
and
for
ourselves
i
could
not
answer
him
for
the
three
chiefs
would
have
heard
me
but
i
had
acted
thus
to
make
intschutschuna
feel
secure
and
less
on
his
guard
one
more
question
i
said
before
i
followed
him
in
case
we
are
free
shall
we
get
back
our
property
he
gave
a
short
impatient
laugh
as
if
he
thought
this
an
insane
question
yes
you
shall
have
it
he
said
everything
everything
even
horses
and
guns
he
turned
on
me
angrily
saying
everything
i
have
said
it
a
crow
flew
beside
an
eagle
in
contest
of
speed
and
asked
what
it
should
receive
if
it
conquered
the
king
of
birds
if
you
swim
as
stupidly
as
you
ask
questions
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
give
you
an
old
squaw
for
an
adversary
we
passed
through
the
halfcircle
which
opened
to
make
way
for
us
as
i
passed
nschotschi
she
gave
me
a
glance
in
which
she
bade
me
farewell
forever
the
indians
followed
us
and
settled
down
to
watch
the
interesting
spectacle
which
was
about
to
begin
chapter
xv
a
swim
for
freedom
i
fully
realized
the
extreme
danger
that
i
was
in
no
matter
how
fast
i
swam
or
what
curves
i
made
the
chiefs
tomahawk
was
sure
to
overtake
me
there
was
but
one
hope
and
that
was
in
swimming
under
water
and
fortunately
i
was
not
the
bungler
i
had
made
intschutschuna
think
me
but
i
could
not
trust
only
to
swimming
under
water
for
i
should
have
to
come
up
to
breathe
and
when
i
did
that
the
tomahawk
would
crash
into
my
skull
no
i
should
not
dare
come
to
the
surface
at
least
where
the
indians
could
see
me
how
should
i
manage
it
was
with
profound
gratitude
to
god
on
whom
in
my
heart
i
was
calling
that
i
saw
that
the
surroundings
were
favorable
to
me
we
stood
on
an
open
sandy
beach
the
end
where
the
woods
began
again
was
only
a
little
over
a
hundred
feet
away
from
me
and
just
beyond
that
the
river
made
a
bend
which
promised
well
and
the
other
end
of
the
strip
of
sand
was
a
good
four
hundred
feet
downstream
if
i
sprang
into
the
water
and
did
not
come
up
again
they
would
naturally
think
i
was
drowned
and
look
for
my
body
down
the
stream
while
my
plan
was
to
swim
under
water
in
the
opposite
direction
there
was
one
spot
not
far
up
where
the
river
had
cut
under
the
bank
which
hung
over
and
made
an
excellent
refuge
for
a
short
breathingspell
further
on
the
bank
was
wooded
to
the
edge
and
an
alluvial
growth
seemed
to
meet
it
which
would
serve
perfectly
for
the
same
purpose
but
before
the
attempt
was
made
cunning
deception
was
necessary
intschutschuna
took
off
all
his
clothes
except
his
light
indian
breeches
stuck
the
tomahawk
into
his
belt
and
said
we
are
ready
jump
in
will
you
let
me
first
try
how
deep
it
is
i
asked
a
contemptuous
smile
passed
over
his
face
as
he
called
for
a
spear
it
was
brought
to
me
and
i
stuck
it
down
in
the
water
to
my
unspeakable
delight
it
did
not
touch
bottom
but
i
acted
more
woebegone
and
scared
than
before
cowering
down
over
the
water
and
dabbling
my
foot
in
it
like
one
who
fears
a
shock
if
the
water
should
touch
him
suddenly
i
heard
a
contemptuous
murmur
behind
me
and
sams
voice
cried
out
for
the
love
of
heaven
come
back
i
cant
look
on
at
this
let
them
torture
us
its
better
than
seeing
such
a
figure
of
wretchedness
before
a
mans
eyes
i
could
not
help
wondering
what
nschotschi
must
think
of
me
i
straightened
myself
and
looked
around
tanguas
face
was
the
incarnation
of
scorn
winnetous
upper
lip
had
curled
till
one
could
see
his
teethhe
was
disgusted
that
he
had
taken
my
part
and
his
sister
kept
her
eyes
down
and
would
no
longer
look
at
me
i
am
ready
what
are
you
waiting
for
now
in
with
you
must
it
really
be
i
stammered
is
there
no
other
way
a
shout
of
laughter
arose
above
which
i
heard
tanguas
voice
crying
let
the
frog
go
give
him
his
life
no
warrior
can
lay
his
hand
on
such
a
coward
and
with
a
low
growl
like
an
angry
tiger
intschutschuna
said
in
with
you
or
ill
split
your
head
with
my
tomahawk
i
shrank
away
sat
down
on
the
river
brink
put
first
a
foot
and
then
a
leg
in
the
water
and
acted
as
though
i
was
going
to
slide
in
in
with
you
cried
intschutschuna
again
and
upset
me
by
a
kick
in
the
back
i
threw
up
my
arms
as
if
i
were
helpless
uttered
a
shriek
of
terror
and
splashed
into
the
water
the
next
moment
this
humbug
was
over
i
struck
bottom
held
my
head
down
and
swam
upstream
as
fast
as
i
could
i
heard
a
splash
behind
me
intschutschuna
had
jumped
in
i
learned
afterward
that
he
had
intended
to
let
me
have
some
headway
and
throw
his
tomahawk
when
i
had
almost
reached
the
other
shore
but
since
i
had
shown
such
cowardice
he
abandoned
this
plan
and
sprang
in
after
me
quickly
intending
to
strike
me
as
soon
as
i
came
up
such
an
idiot
was
to
be
disposed
of
in
short
order
i
reached
the
spot
where
the
bank
hung
over
the
stream
and
let
my
mouth
come
to
the
surface
no
one
could
see
me
except
the
chief
because
i
was
under
water
and
to
my
grateful
delight
he
kept
his
eyes
downstream
i
drew
quick
deep
breaths
and
sank
again
to
continue
my
way
next
i
came
to
the
alluvial
woods
under
which
i
rose
again
to
breathe
my
head
was
so
well
concealed
that
i
ventured
to
remain
longer
at
the
surface
and
i
saw
the
chief
lying
on
the
water
like
a
wild
beast
ready
any
instant
to
pounce
on
its
prey
now
the
last
and
longest
stretch
lay
before
me
to
the
beginning
of
the
woods
where
shrubs
and
undergrowth
hung
over
the
bank
this
i
accomplished
happily
and
won
the
bank
completely
covered
with
twigs
now
to
reach
the
bend
of
the
river
already
mentioned
go
around
it
and
swim
to
the
opposite
bank
and
this
must
be
done
most
quickly
of
all
for
there
was
no
place
after
this
where
i
could
come
up
to
breathe
now
st
christopher
brave
ferryman
help
me
i
thought
but
before
i
started
i
peered
out
through
the
bushes
at
those
whom
i
had
fooled
they
stood
shouting
and
questioning
on
the
bank
while
the
chief
still
swam
back
and
forth
waiting
for
me
although
i
could
not
possibly
have
remained
so
long
under
water
i
wondered
whether
sam
hawkins
remembered
that
i
had
said
that
if
i
were
drowned
we
were
saved
i
ran
through
the
woods
till
i
had
left
the
bend
of
the
river
behind
me
took
to
the
water
again
and
crossed
safely
thanks
to
being
considered
such
a
bad
swimmer
and
afraid
of
the
water
yet
it
was
a
clumsy
trick
by
which
they
had
been
fooled
for
they
had
known
enough
of
me
before
to
be
sure
i
was
no
coward
i
followed
the
woods
downstream
to
their
end
here
looking
through
the
bushes
i
saw
to
my
amusement
that
several
indians
had
jumped
into
the
stream
and
were
poking
about
with
their
spears
to
find
old
shatterhands
body
i
could
easily
have
walked
over
to
the
cedar
but
i
did
not
wish
to
owe
my
victory
to
craft
alone
but
to
give
intschutschuna
a
little
lesson
and
make
him
grateful
to
me
he
still
swam
around
the
same
spot
for
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
look
over
to
the
other
bank
i
slipped
into
the
water
again
lay
on
my
back
so
that
my
mouth
and
nose
were
above
water
and
slowly
propelled
myself
downward
paddling
with
my
hands
no
one
noticed
me
when
i
got
level
with
them
i
stood
up
treading
water
and
shouted
sam
hawkins
sam
hawkins
we
have
won
we
have
won
the
indians
heard
me
looked
over
and
what
a
howl
arose
no
one
who
has
ever
heard
such
a
sound
will
forget
it
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
as
soon
as
intschutschuna
espied
me
he
swam
towards
me
with
long
bold
strokes
or
rather
darted
towards
me
i
dared
not
wait
too
long
but
retreated
to
the
bank
which
i
climbed
and
remained
standing
there
quick
get
to
the
cedar
quick
shouted
sam
hawkins
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
my
doing
so
but
still
i
did
not
move
for
he
was
not
yet
dangerously
near
then
i
ran
swiftly
towards
the
tree
had
i
been
in
the
water
he
could
have
thrown
the
tomahawk
even
at
that
distance
but
i
was
sure
he
would
not
use
it
till
we
were
on
a
level
the
tree
was
three
hundred
feet
away
when
i
had
made
half
this
distance
as
fast
as
i
could
i
stopped
again
and
looked
back
just
as
the
chief
came
out
of
the
water
he
pulled
the
tomahawk
from
his
belt
and
ran
towards
me
i
did
not
move
but
as
he
came
dangerously
close
i
turned
as
if
to
fly
but
only
apparently
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
not
throw
the
tomahawk
when
i
stood
still
for
i
could
then
dodge
it
so
i
started
running
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
around
right
he
had
paused
to
make
his
throw
surer
swung
his
weapon
around
his
head
and
even
as
i
turned
hurled
it
at
me
i
leaped
to
one
side
the
tomahawk
flew
past
me
and
buried
itself
in
the
sand
that
was
what
i
wanted
i
ran
over
drew
it
out
and
instead
of
going
on
to
the
tree
walked
deliberately
over
to
the
chief
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
sprang
at
me
like
a
madman
i
raised
the
tomahawk
and
called
to
him
halt
intschutschuna
you
deceived
yourself
in
old
shatterhand
do
you
want
your
own
weapon
buried
in
your
skull
he
paused
and
cried
dog
how
did
you
escape
me
in
the
water
the
wicked
spirit
has
helped
you
dont
you
believe
that
if
any
spirit
has
defended
me
it
is
the
good
manitou
as
i
spoke
i
saw
a
secret
determination
light
his
eyes
as
he
watched
me
and
i
said
warningly
you
mean
to
surprise
and
attack
me
i
see
it
dont
do
it
for
it
would
be
your
death
i
will
do
you
no
harm
for
i
really
care
for
you
and
winnetou
but
if
you
attack
i
must
defend
myself
you
know
that
i
am
stronger
than
you
without
a
weapon
and
i
have
your
tomahawk
be
wise
and
i
could
say
no
more
his
wrath
mastered
him
beyond
control
of
his
reason
he
threw
himself
towards
me
with
hands
outstretched
like
claws
he
thought
he
had
me
but
i
slipped
aside
and
the
force
of
his
own
weight
threw
him
down
instantly
i
was
over
him
putting
my
left
knee
on
one
arm
my
right
on
the
other
i
held
him
with
the
left
hand
by
the
throat
swung
the
tomahawk
and
cried
intschutschuna
do
you
ask
for
mercy
no
then
ill
split
your
head
kill
me
you
dog
he
gasped
struggling
to
get
away
no
you
are
winnetous
father
and
shall
live
but
i
must
make
you
take
a
nap
for
a
little
while
you
leave
me
no
choice
i
struck
his
head
with
the
flat
side
of
the
tomahawka
severe
blow
his
limbs
drew
up
convulsively
and
then
stretched
out
at
full
length
it
looked
from
where
the
indians
stood
as
though
i
had
killed
him
and
again
i
heard
that
awful
howl
i
bound
the
chiefs
arms
down
to
his
side
with
his
belt
dragged
him
over
to
the
cedar
and
laid
him
at
its
foot
i
had
to
reach
the
tree
under
the
conditions
laid
down
to
complete
the
work
and
win
our
freedom
then
i
left
intschutschuna
lying
there
and
ran
quickly
back
to
the
bank
for
three
indians
had
thrown
themselves
into
the
stream
and
were
swimming
over
winnetou
at
their
head
in
case
they
did
not
keep
their
word
this
was
too
many
so
i
called
to
them
as
i
reached
the
river
your
chief
lives
i
have
done
him
no
harm
but
if
you
come
here
i
will
kill
you
only
winnetou
shall
cross
for
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
they
paid
no
attention
to
these
words
but
winnetou
rose
in
the
water
where
they
could
all
see
him
and
uttered
a
word
which
i
did
not
understand
they
obeyed
it
turned
back
and
he
came
on
alone
i
waited
for
him
at
the
waters
edge
and
as
he
emerged
from
it
said
it
is
well
they
turned
back
for
it
would
have
proved
dangerous
to
your
father
to
have
allowed
them
to
come
you
have
slain
him
with
the
tomahawk
no
he
forced
me
to
strike
him
unconscious
because
he
would
not
give
in
and
you
could
have
killed
him
he
was
in
your
hands
i
would
not
willingly
kill
an
enemy
certainly
not
a
man
i
like
and
who
is
winnetous
father
here
is
his
tomahawk
you
shall
decide
whether
or
not
i
have
conquered
and
the
promise
to
me
and
my
comrades
shall
be
fulfilled
he
took
the
tomahawk
which
i
held
out
to
him
and
regarded
me
long
and
steadily
his
eyes
grew
milder
and
milder
their
expression
changing
into
one
of
amazement
and
at
last
he
said
what
kind
of
a
man
is
old
shatterhand
who
can
understand
him
you
will
learn
to
understand
me
you
give
me
this
weapon
not
knowing
whether
we
will
keep
our
word
or
not
yet
you
could
defend
yourself
with
it
do
you
know
you
have
delivered
yourself
into
my
hands
pshaw
im
not
afraid
for
in
any
case
i
have
my
hands
and
winnetou
is
no
liar
but
a
noble
warrior
whose
word
will
never
be
broken
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
me
and
replied
you
are
right
you
are
free
and
the
other
palefaces
also
except
the
man
called
rattler
you
have
confidence
in
me
would
i
could
have
confidence
in
you
you
will
yet
trust
me
as
much
as
i
trust
you
wait
only
a
little
while
now
come
to
your
father
yes
come
when
old
shatterhand
strikes
death
may
follow
even
when
he
does
not
intend
it
we
went
over
to
the
chief
winnetou
examined
him
and
then
said
he
lives
and
will
come
to
himself
later
with
an
aching
head
i
must
not
stay
here
but
i
will
send
some
men
over
to
him
my
brother
old
shatterhand
may
come
with
me
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
called
me
my
brother
how
often
i
heard
him
say
it
afterward
and
how
sincere
true
and
faithful
he
was
saying
it
we
turned
back
and
swam
across
the
river
the
indians
stood
on
the
opposite
bank
and
saw
us
coming
they
could
perceive
the
difference
in
winnetous
manner
to
me
and
must
have
recognized
the
fact
that
i
was
not
what
they
supposed
either
in
the
wrong
done
to
them
or
in
cowardice
as
we
reached
the
bank
winnetou
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
old
shatterhand
has
conquered
he
and
his
three
comrades
are
free
uff
uff
uff
cried
the
apaches
while
tangua
stood
looking
at
us
darkly
winnetou
strode
past
him
without
looking
at
him
and
led
me
to
the
stakes
to
which
my
three
comrades
were
bound
hallelujah
cried
sam
we
are
saved
man
youngster
tenderfoot
how
did
you
do
it
winnetou
gave
me
his
knife
cut
their
bonds
he
said
you
deserve
to
do
it
yourself
i
did
so
as
soon
as
they
were
free
they
threw
themselves
on
me
and
took
me
in
their
arms
hugging
me
till
i
was
actually
hurt
sam
even
kissed
my
hand
with
tears
dropping
into
his
beard
my
dear
boy
he
said
if
ever
i
forget
you
may
the
first
grizzly
i
meet
devour
me
skin
and
hair
how
did
you
do
this
you
were
so
afraid
of
the
water
and
everybody
thought
you
were
drowned
did
i
not
tell
you
that
if
i
were
drowned
we
were
saved
did
old
shatterhand
say
this
before
the
contest
asked
winnetou
was
it
then
all
planned
beforehand
yes
i
nodded
my
brother
knew
what
he
would
do
my
brother
is
not
only
as
strong
as
a
bear
but
as
cunning
as
the
fox
of
the
prairie
whoso
is
his
enemy
must
be
on
his
guard
and
is
winnetou
such
an
enemy
i
was
but
am
no
longer
so
you
no
more
believe
tangua
the
liar
but
me
again
he
looked
at
me
long
and
searchingly
as
before
extended
his
hand
and
said
your
eyes
are
good
eyes
and
there
is
no
dishonesty
in
your
face
i
believe
you
i
had
resumed
my
discarded
clothing
and
took
my
tin
box
from
the
pocket
of
my
huntingjacket
and
said
therein
has
my
brother
winnetou
done
me
justice
i
will
prove
it
to
him
perhaps
he
may
know
what
this
is
i
unrolled
the
lock
of
hair
and
held
it
up
before
him
he
put
out
his
hand
to
take
it
stopped
short
and
stepped
back
completely
amazed
crying
it
is
my
own
hair
who
gave
you
this
intschutschuna
said
this
morning
in
his
address
that
the
great
spirit
had
sent
you
an
unknown
deliverer
when
you
were
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
kiowas
yes
he
was
unknown
for
he
dared
not
let
the
kiowas
see
him
but
now
there
is
no
longer
need
of
his
concealing
himself
you
may
truly
believe
that
i
was
not
your
foe
but
your
friend
youyouit
is
you
who
freed
us
he
gasped
more
and
more
overcome
he
who
never
betrayed
surprise
then
we
owe
you
not
only
our
freedom
but
our
lives
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
drew
me
to
the
place
where
his
sister
stood
watching
us
intently
he
led
me
before
her
and
said
nschotschi
see
here
the
brave
warrior
who
secretly
freed
our
father
and
me
when
we
were
bound
to
the
trees
by
the
kiowas
let
us
thank
him
with
these
words
he
drew
me
to
him
and
kissed
me
on
each
cheek
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
saying
only
forgive
she
was
to
thank
me
but
instead
begged
for
forgiveness
but
i
understood
her
she
had
been
secretly
unjust
to
me
as
my
nurse
she
should
have
known
me
better
than
the
others
yet
she
too
had
doubted
me
and
taken
me
for
a
miserable
coward
she
felt
that
it
was
more
important
to
make
this
right
than
to
thank
me
as
winnetou
wished
i
pressed
her
hand
and
said
nschotschi
will
remember
all
i
said
to
her
now
it
is
fulfilled
will
my
sister
believe
me
now
fair
day
smiled
on
me
and
said
simply
i
believe
my
white
brother
i
went
back
to
explain
to
my
three
friends
the
mystery
of
the
lock
of
hair
and
tell
them
that
it
was
i
who
had
freed
the
chiefs
while
winnetou
went
to
seek
his
father
presently
we
saw
them
returning
and
went
to
meet
them
intschutschuna
looked
at
me
with
the
same
searching
gaze
his
son
had
given
me
then
he
said
winnetou
has
told
me
all
you
are
free
and
will
forgive
us
you
are
a
mighty
and
cunning
warrior
and
will
conquer
many
foes
he
who
is
wise
will
be
your
friend
will
you
smoke
the
calumet
of
peace
with
us
yes
i
would
gladly
be
your
friend
and
brother
then
come
with
me
and
nschotschi
my
daughter
to
the
pueblo
i
will
give
my
conqueror
a
dwelling
worthy
of
him
winnetou
stay
here
to
make
the
arrangements
you
know
of
we
went
back
with
him
and
nschotschi
as
free
men
to
the
pueblo
which
we
had
quitted
prisoners
on
our
way
to
death
chapter
xvi
tanguas
punishment
as
we
approached
the
pueblo
i
saw
for
the
first
time
what
an
imposing
stone
structure
it
was
the
american
savage
has
not
been
supposed
to
have
had
ability
to
build
but
men
who
could
raise
such
masses
of
stone
as
the
southwestern
indians
have
put
into
their
pyramidal
pueblos
and
knew
how
to
fasten
them
securely
with
such
insufficient
tools
as
they
possessed
surely
did
not
stand
in
the
lowest
ranks
of
intelligence
or
knowledge
of
architecture
and
though
it
is
said
with
truth
that
these
indians
once
possessed
knowledge
which
their
descendants
have
lost
it
must
be
remembered
that
if
time
and
opportunity
for
advancement
be
denied
them
they
must
inevitably
deteriorate
and
their
present
inferiority
proves
rather
the
oppression
of
the
white
man
than
the
incapacity
of
the
red
man
we
climbed
to
the
raised
platform
behind
which
lay
the
best
apartments
of
the
pueblo
there
intschutschuna
dwelt
with
his
children
and
there
apartments
were
given
us
also
mine
was
a
large
room
which
like
my
first
one
had
no
window
receiving
its
light
only
through
the
door
but
this
was
so
broad
and
high
that
there
was
plenty
of
light
the
room
was
bare
but
nschotschi
furnished
it
quickly
with
skins
covers
and
ornaments
so
that
i
felt
at
home
at
once
hawkins
stone
and
parker
were
given
a
pleasant
room
together
when
the
guestchamber
had
been
prepared
and
i
had
taken
possession
of
it
fair
day
brought
me
a
beautifully
carved
pipe
of
peace
with
tobacco
she
filled
it
herself
lighted
it
and
as
i
drew
the
first
whiff
said
my
father
intschutschuna
sends
you
this
pipe
he
took
the
clay
for
it
himself
from
the
sacred
stone
quarry
and
i
cut
it
no
man
has
ever
had
it
between
his
lips
and
we
beg
you
to
accept
it
for
your
own
and
remember
us
when
you
smoke
it
your
goodness
is
great
i
said
i
feel
ashamed
that
i
can
make
no
gift
in
return
you
have
already
given
us
so
much
that
we
cannot
thank
you
for
it
the
lives
of
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
were
in
your
hands
and
you
spared
them
and
today
again
you
might
have
killed
the
chief
and
you
did
not
do
so
therefore
our
hearts
turn
to
you
and
if
you
will
you
shall
be
our
brother
if
that
may
be
then
my
dearest
wish
will
be
fulfilled
intschutschuna
is
a
renowned
warrior
and
i
have
loved
winnetou
from
the
first
moment
that
i
saw
him
it
would
not
only
be
a
great
honor
but
a
great
joy
to
be
the
brother
of
such
men
i
only
wish
that
my
comrades
could
share
it
if
they
will
they
shall
be
treated
as
if
they
had
been
born
apaches
we
thank
you
for
this
so
you
carved
the
head
of
this
pipe
yourself
how
skilful
your
hands
are
she
blushed
over
this
praise
and
said
i
know
that
the
women
and
daughters
of
the
palefaces
are
far
more
skilful
than
we
now
i
will
go
and
bring
you
something
else
she
disappeared
and
returned
with
my
revolver
my
knife
and
everything
else
that
had
been
in
my
pockets
with
nothing
missing
or
injured
and
how
about
our
horses
i
asked
they
are
all
here
you
shall
ride
yours
again
and
hawkins
is
to
have
his
nancy
so
you
know
the
mules
name
yes
and
the
name
of
the
old
gun
which
he
calls
his
liddy
when
you
were
ill
i
used
to
go
to
him
every
day
to
tell
him
you
were
progressing
he
is
a
funny
man
but
a
good
hunter
yes
and
he
is
far
more
than
that
he
is
a
true
selfsacrificing
comrade
whom
you
cant
help
loving
now
will
you
answer
a
question
truthfully
nschotschi
does
not
lie
she
replied
simply
and
proudly
and
least
of
all
would
i
lie
to
you
then
why
did
your
warriors
leave
the
contents
of
my
pockets
untouched
when
they
took
everything
away
from
my
comrades
and
the
kiowas
because
my
brother
winnetou
ordered
it
so
and
do
you
know
why
he
gave
such
an
order
because
he
liked
you
although
he
considered
me
his
enemy
yes
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
you
liked
him
from
the
moment
you
first
saw
him
he
had
a
similar
feeling
for
you
it
grieved
him
to
be
forced
to
hold
you
his
enemy
and
not
only
an
enemy
she
stopped
evidently
because
what
she
was
going
to
say
would
have
wounded
me
say
on
i
said
she
shook
her
head
then
ill
finish
for
you
it
did
not
grieve
him
so
much
to
consider
me
his
enemy
for
one
can
respect
an
enemy
but
to
consider
me
a
liar
a
treacherous
false
man
is
that
it
you
have
said
it
never
mind
i
think
he
knows
now
he
was
mistaken
what
about
rattler
he
will
be
tortured
in
a
little
while
and
why
was
i
not
told
winnetou
would
have
it
so
he
thought
your
eyes
could
not
see
nor
your
ears
hear
his
agony
ive
no
doubt
he
is
right
but
if
i
can
bring
about
what
i
desire
i
can
bear
it
in
any
case
i
must
be
there
what
torture
is
intended
for
him
everything
possible
he
is
the
worst
paleface
that
the
apaches
have
ever
captured
he
killed
our
white
father
whom
we
loved
and
honored
and
for
no
reason
therefore
he
must
die
by
every
agony
which
we
know
slow
and
longcontinued
that
must
not
be
it
is
inhuman
he
deserves
it
and
can
you
look
at
it
yes
you
a
maiden
she
dropped
her
long
lashes
and
then
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
your
women
are
not
more
tenderhearted
than
we
they
do
cruel
things
only
for
their
own
pleasure
kill
little
birds
for
their
feathers
and
are
not
always
gentle
klekipetrah
has
told
me
of
them
our
ways
are
not
your
ways
but
a
womans
heart
is
everywhere
the
same
whatever
the
color
of
her
skin
the
white
men
have
not
taught
the
indian
kindness
truth
or
justice
i
can
look
on
the
punishment
of
a
man
who
in
murdering
klekipetrah
has
given
us
pain
greater
than
his
but
i
ask
you
not
to
come
to
see
rattler
tortured
for
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
will
not
be
pleased
if
they
see
you
coming
with
me
i
will
go
with
you
none
the
less
and
they
will
pardon
it
i
said
we
descended
the
ladder
again
and
met
winnetou
when
we
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
i
had
completely
forgotten
tangua
until
that
moment
when
i
saw
him
standing
near
and
there
was
no
mistaking
how
angry
he
was
i
went
up
to
him
and
looking
him
steadily
in
the
face
demanded
is
tangua
the
kiowa
chief
a
liar
or
does
he
love
truth
would
you
insult
me
he
shrieked
no
i
only
want
to
know
answer
me
old
shatterhand
must
know
that
i
love
truth
he
said
you
remember
then
what
you
said
to
me
when
i
was
bound
over
yonder
i
said
many
things
to
you
you
certainly
did
but
you
know
what
i
mean
if
you
dont
ill
help
your
memory
you
said
that
we
should
have
a
settlement
did
i
say
that
he
asked
elevating
his
brows
yes
and
you
said
further
that
you
would
be
glad
to
fight
me
for
you
would
crush
me
i
dont
remember
that
old
shatterhand
must
have
misunderstood
me
no
winnetou
was
there
and
can
confirm
it
yes
said
winnetou
readily
tangua
said
he
would
settle
with
old
shatterhand
whom
he
would
gladly
fight
for
he
would
crush
him
now
i
continued
you
called
me
a
frog
without
courage
and
tried
in
every
way
to
do
me
harm
youve
got
to
eat
your
words
i
felt
that
i
must
punish
this
indian
not
merely
for
justice
sake
and
the
effect
on
the
apaches
but
for
the
benefit
of
those
white
men
whom
he
might
meet
in
the
future
my
brother
old
shatterhand
is
right
said
winnetou
if
you
do
not
keep
your
promise
you
will
be
a
coward
and
should
be
expelled
from
your
tribe
such
things
must
not
happen
here
for
no
man
shall
reproach
the
apaches
with
having
a
coward
for
a
guest
what
does
the
kiowa
chief
intend
to
do
i
will
consider
it
for
a
brave
warrior
there
is
nothing
to
consider
fight
or
be
called
a
coward
tangua
drew
himself
up
saying
haughtily
tangua
a
coward
i
will
bury
my
knife
in
the
heart
of
him
who
says
it
i
say
iti
said
winnetou
coolly
if
you
do
not
keep
your
word
to
old
shatterhand
i
will
keep
it
then
are
you
ready
this
moment
i
long
to
taste
his
blood
good
old
shatterhand
will
decide
the
weapons
for
you
insulted
him
no
i
am
a
chief
and
am
greater
than
he
let
him
choose
i
interrupted
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
what
they
are
it
shall
be
guns
two
hundred
paces
apart
and
i
will
shoot
first
winnetou
shook
his
head
tangua
would
have
all
the
advantages
for
himself
he
said
old
shatterhand
must
shoot
first
no
i
said
he
shall
have
his
way
let
him
shoot
once
and
i
once
and
no
more
no
said
tangua
we
will
shoot
till
one
falls
certainly
for
after
my
first
shot
you
will
be
down
boaster
you
will
see
i
could
kill
you
but
i
will
not
the
most
severe
punishment
for
you
would
be
to
lame
you
i
will
break
your
right
knee
remember
do
you
hear
that
he
laughed
this
paleface
whom
his
own
friends
call
a
greenhorn
announces
beforehand
where
his
shot
shall
go
at
two
hundred
paces
braves
let
us
laugh
at
him
he
looked
around
invitingly
but
no
one
laughed
and
he
said
you
are
afraid
of
him
but
i
will
show
you
how
i
mock
him
come
let
us
measure
the
paces
while
this
was
being
done
i
got
my
gun
examined
it
and
found
it
in
good
condition
both
barrels
were
loaded
but
to
be
sure
of
them
i
discharged
and
reloaded
them
sam
came
up
and
said
i
have
a
hundred
questions
to
ask
you
and
cant
get
a
chance
however
theres
one
thing
i
must
ask
you
and
that
is
if
youre
really
going
to
shoot
this
fellow
in
the
knee
yes
only
there
that
is
punishment
enough
no
it
certainly
is
not
such
vermin
ought
to
be
stamped
on
only
think
of
what
he
has
been
guilty
and
everything
has
come
from
his
having
stolen
the
apaches
horses
in
the
first
place
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
put
a
bullet
into
his
head
hell
do
his
best
to
get
one
into
yours
or
in
my
heart
i
know
that
perfectly
well
but
he
wont
succeed
these
kiowas
are
no
good
at
shooting
the
ground
has
been
measured
by
this
time
and
we
took
our
places
i
was
quiet
as
usual
but
tangua
poured
out
a
stream
of
abuse
upon
me
till
winnetou
who
stood
on
one
side
between
us
said
let
the
kiowa
chief
be
silent
and
pay
attention
i
will
count
three
and
then
he
may
shoot
he
who
shoots
before
the
time
shall
have
my
bullet
in
his
head
of
course
all
the
indians
were
watching
us
with
intense
interest
they
had
divided
into
two
files
to
right
and
left
of
us
so
that
a
broad
path
ran
between
them
at
the
end
of
which
we
stood
the
deepest
stillness
reigned
the
chief
of
the
kiowas
may
begin
said
winnetou
onetwothree
i
stood
still
presenting
the
entire
width
of
my
body
to
my
antagonist
at
winnetous
first
word
he
raised
his
gun
aimed
carefully
and
at
three
fired
the
shot
went
over
me
close
to
my
head
no
one
uttered
a
sound
now
old
shatterhand
may
shoot
said
winnetou
onetwo
wait
i
interrupted
i
stand
up
fairly
to
the
kiowa
chief
but
he
has
turned
half
around
so
that
the
side
of
his
face
is
towards
me
i
may
do
so
said
tangua
who
shall
forbid
it
there
was
nothing
said
as
to
how
we
should
stand
that
is
true
and
tangua
certainly
may
stand
as
he
likes
he
has
turned
his
side
to
me
because
that
being
narrower
than
the
breast
he
thinks
it
will
be
harder
for
me
to
hit
but
he
is
mistaken
i
can
hit
him
just
as
well
i
might
have
shot
without
a
word
but
ill
be
honorable
with
him
he
was
to
have
a
wound
only
in
the
right
knee
but
now
that
cannot
be
for
if
he
stands
with
his
side
towards
me
the
shot
will
shatter
both
knees
that
is
the
only
difference
he
can
do
as
he
likes
i
have
warned
him
shoot
with
bullets
and
not
with
words
he
answered
ignoring
my
warning
now
old
shatterhand
shoots
said
winnetou
onetwothree
my
bullet
whistled
through
the
air
tangua
uttered
a
loud
shriek
dropped
his
gun
threw
up
his
arms
waved
them
about
wildly
and
fell
uff
uff
uff
echoed
all
around
and
every
one
ran
over
to
see
where
he
had
been
wounded
i
also
went
over
the
indians
respectfully
making
way
for
me
in
both
knees
in
both
knees
i
heard
on
all
sides
tangua
lay
moaning
on
the
ground
as
i
came
up
winnetou
knelt
by
him
examining
the
wound
he
saw
me
coming
and
said
the
shot
has
gone
just
where
my
white
brother
said
it
should
it
has
broken
both
knees
tangua
can
never
again
ride
out
to
cast
his
eyes
on
the
horses
of
another
tribe
when
the
wounded
man
saw
me
he
began
another
torrent
of
abuse
but
i
compelled
him
to
be
silent
a
moment
and
said
i
warned
you
and
you
would
not
heed
the
warning
you
alone
are
to
blame
he
dared
not
complain
of
the
pain
for
under
no
circumstances
may
an
indian
do
this
he
bit
his
lip
looked
sullenly
around
and
growled
i
am
wounded
and
cannot
go
home
i
must
stay
with
the
apaches
winnetou
shook
his
head
and
answered
decidedly
you
will
go
home
for
we
have
no
room
for
the
thief
of
our
horses
and
the
murderer
of
our
braves
we
have
not
avenged
ourselves
with
blood
but
have
accepted
ransom
in
beasts
and
goods
more
you
cannot
expect
no
kiowa
belongs
in
our
pueblo
but
i
cannot
ride
old
shatterhand
was
much
more
severely
wounded
than
you
are
and
could
not
ride
yet
he
had
to
come
with
us
think
of
him
often
it
will
be
good
for
you
the
kiowas
must
leave
here
today
and
those
of
them
that
we
find
in
our
domains
tomorrow
we
will
treat
as
they
wished
old
shatterhand
to
be
treated
i
have
spoken
how
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
away
and
i
knew
though
he
said
nothing
that
he
was
pleased
with
the
result
of
this
last
adventure
and
the
punishment
of
his
treacherous
foe
chapter
xvii
the
end
of
rattler
winnetou
and
i
walked
a
little
distance
away
from
the
indians
who
were
still
assembling
to
see
rattlers
torture
when
we
had
gone
beyond
their
hearing
winnetou
asked
me
gravely
why
i
had
left
the
pueblo
we
came
back
because
we
heard
that
rattler
was
soon
to
die
is
that
so
i
asked
yes
i
do
not
see
him
anywhere
he
lies
in
the
cart
beside
the
body
of
his
victim
i
was
told
that
he
was
to
be
tortured
and
i
cannot
look
upon
such
a
death
therefore
my
father
intschutschuna
took
you
back
to
the
pueblo
why
did
you
not
stay
there
why
do
you
want
to
see
something
you
cannot
look
upon
i
hope
that
i
may
be
present
at
his
death
without
being
shocked
my
religion
teaches
me
to
plead
with
you
for
rattler
your
religion
is
it
not
his
also
yes
and
no
he
was
born
a
christian
but
not
a
catholic
christian
did
he
keep
its
commandments
most
certainly
he
did
not
then
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
observe
them
in
regard
to
him
your
religion
forbids
murder
nevertheless
he
is
a
murderer
so
the
teachings
of
your
religion
are
not
to
be
applied
to
our
treatment
of
him
i
cannot
be
guided
by
what
he
has
done
i
must
fulfil
my
duty
without
regard
to
other
mens
shortcomings
i
beg
of
you
modify
your
decision
and
let
this
man
die
a
speedy
death
what
has
been
determined
upon
must
be
carried
out
and
is
there
no
way
to
fulfil
my
request
winnetous
eyes
sought
the
ground
he
thought
earnestly
for
a
while
then
said
there
is
a
way
but
before
i
tell
my
white
brother
what
it
is
i
must
beg
him
not
to
use
it
for
it
would
disgrace
him
sorely
in
the
eyes
of
our
warriors
how
would
it
is
it
a
dishonorable
action
in
the
eyes
of
a
red
man
it
is
you
would
have
to
appeal
to
our
gratitude
oh
no
decent
man
would
do
that
no
we
owe
you
our
lives
if
you
appeal
to
that
fact
you
could
force
my
father
and
me
to
do
your
will
we
would
hold
a
new
council
and
during
it
we
would
speak
of
you
in
such
a
way
that
our
warriors
must
acknowledge
our
debt
to
you
and
grant
your
desire
but
henceforth
everything
you
have
done
for
us
would
be
valueless
is
this
rattler
worth
such
a
sacrifice
certainly
not
my
brother
sees
that
i
speak
frankly
to
him
i
know
the
thoughts
and
feelings
in
his
heart
but
my
braves
would
never
grasp
them
a
man
who
appealed
to
gratitude
would
be
contemptible
to
them
shall
old
shatterhand
who
can
become
the
greatest
and
most
renowned
warrior
of
the
apaches
be
driven
away
from
us
today
because
our
braves
despise
him
it
was
hard
for
me
to
answer
my
heart
bade
me
press
my
request
my
commonsense
forbade
it
winnetou
understood
the
struggle
within
me
and
said
i
will
speak
to
intschutschuna
my
father
my
brother
may
wait
here
dont
do
anything
foolish
said
sam
as
he
left
us
you
dont
know
how
much
may
depend
on
this
maybe
life
itself
oh
that
couldnt
be
i
said
indeed
it
could
easily
the
red
man
so
greatly
despises
any
one
who
asks
a
favor
on
the
strength
of
what
has
been
done
for
him
that
we
actually
could
not
stay
here
if
you
did
it
and
if
we
left
here
we
should
surely
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
kiowas
and
theres
no
need
of
telling
you
what
that
means
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
talked
earnestly
together
for
a
while
then
they
came
to
us
and
the
former
said
had
not
klekipetrah
told
me
so
much
of
your
faith
i
should
feel
you
were
a
man
to
whom
it
was
a
disgrace
to
talk
but
i
can
understand
your
wish
perfectly
though
if
my
warriors
were
to
hear
it
they
would
never
understand
and
would
only
despise
you
it
is
not
a
question
of
my
wish
alone
but
of
klekipetrahs
of
whom
you
speak
i
said
how
is
it
a
question
of
his
desire
he
believed
in
this
same
faith
which
commands
me
to
make
this
plea
and
he
died
in
it
his
religion
bade
him
forgive
his
enemies
believe
me
if
he
could
speak
he
would
not
consent
to
his
murderer
dying
such
a
death
do
you
really
think
so
i
know
it
he
shook
his
head
slowly
what
kind
of
men
are
you
christians
either
you
are
bad
and
then
your
wickedness
is
so
great
that
no
one
can
understand
it
or
else
you
are
good
and
then
your
goodness
is
equally
incomprehensible
he
and
his
son
looked
at
each
other
and
spoke
together
privately
but
only
for
a
moment
then
intschutschuna
turned
back
to
me
and
said
this
murderer
was
your
enemy
also
yes
and
you
have
forgiven
him
yes
then
hear
me
we
will
see
if
there
is
the
least
tiniest
spark
of
goodness
in
him
should
we
find
one
we
will
try
to
do
as
you
wish
without
disgracing
you
sit
here
and
wait
if
i
give
you
a
signal
come
over
to
the
murderer
and
tell
him
to
ask
your
pardon
if
he
does
this
he
shall
die
quickly
and
may
i
tell
him
so
yes
intschutschuna
went
back
with
winnetou
to
the
circle
of
braves
and
we
sat
down
where
we
were
i
never
dreamed
that
the
chief
would
listen
to
you
said
sam
hawkins
you
must
stand
well
with
him
that
is
not
the
only
reason
it
is
the
influence
of
klekipetrah
powerful
though
he
is
dead
these
indians
have
absorbed
more
real
interior
christianity
than
you
suspect
we
looked
over
towards
the
cart
wherein
the
doomed
man
lay
and
saw
a
long
boxlike
object
on
which
a
man
was
bound
that
is
the
coffin
said
sam
made
of
hollow
logs
with
wet
leather
drawn
over
them
which
will
be
airtight
when
the
leather
has
dried
klekipetrahs
body
has
been
embalmed
you
know
not
far
from
the
head
of
the
valley
rose
a
cliff
on
which
an
open
square
had
been
newly
made
of
great
stones
piled
on
top
of
each
other
and
many
more
stones
had
been
gathered
together
around
it
the
man
bound
on
the
coffin
was
now
carried
to
this
square
it
was
rattler
do
you
know
why
those
stones
have
been
collected
there
asked
sam
to
build
a
tomb
i
suppose
yes
a
double
tomb
for
rattler
too
yes
they
will
bury
the
murderer
with
his
victim
horrible
think
of
being
bound
alive
to
the
coffin
of
the
man
one
killed
knowing
that
is
to
be
ones
last
restingplace
i
really
believe
you
are
sorry
for
this
man
i
can
understand
your
interceding
for
a
quick
death
for
him
but
i
certainly
cant
understand
your
pity
for
him
the
coffin
was
now
raised
so
that
rattler
was
placed
on
his
feet
and
he
was
bound
fast
by
strong
ropes
to
the
stone
wall
of
the
tomb
the
indians
men
women
and
children
drew
near
to
the
place
and
made
a
halfcircle
around
it
profound
expectant
silence
reigned
intschutschuna
stood
before
the
coffin
and
spoke
the
apache
braves
are
gathered
here
because
their
people
have
suffered
a
great
loss
and
he
who
has
caused
it
must
pay
for
it
with
his
life
he
said
he
then
spoke
in
the
figurative
indian
manner
of
klekipetrah
telling
them
of
his
character
and
work
and
the
way
in
which
he
had
met
his
death
and
concluded
by
announcing
that
it
had
been
decided
that
rattler
was
now
to
be
tortured
bound
as
he
then
was
to
the
coffin
and
should
be
buried
with
his
victim
turning
to
me
at
this
point
he
gave
me
the
expected
signal
and
we
went
forward
and
were
admitted
into
the
circle
i
had
been
too
far
away
before
to
see
rattler
clearly
but
now
as
i
stood
before
him
wicked
and
godless
as
he
was
i
felt
the
most
profound
pity
for
the
wretch
the
coffin
was
twice
the
width
of
a
mans
body
and
over
eight
feet
long
rattler
was
fastened
with
his
back
to
it
his
arms
behind
him
and
his
feet
stretched
apart
he
showed
that
he
had
suffered
from
hunger
and
thirst
a
gag
was
in
his
mouth
and
he
could
not
speak
his
head
too
was
fastened
so
that
he
could
not
move
it
as
i
came
up
intschutschuna
took
the
gag
out
of
his
mouth
and
said
my
white
brother
wished
to
speak
to
this
murderer
now
he
may
do
so
rattler
could
see
that
i
was
free
and
must
be
on
good
terms
with
the
indians
i
thought
therefore
that
he
would
ask
me
to
speak
a
good
word
for
him
but
instead
of
this
as
soon
as
the
gag
was
removed
he
said
to
me
bitterly
what
do
you
want
of
me
get
out
of
here
i
dont
want
anything
to
do
with
you
you
have
heard
that
you
were
doomed
to
die
rattler
i
said
gently
there
is
no
way
out
of
that
die
you
must
but
get
out
you
dog
get
out
he
shrieked
trying
to
spit
upon
me
but
failing
because
he
could
not
move
his
head
you
must
die
i
continued
unmoved
but
how
depends
upon
yourself
you
are
to
be
tortured
that
means
long
long
agony
through
all
this
day
and
perhaps
tomorrow
it
is
horrible
to
think
of
and
i
want
you
to
escape
it
at
my
request
intschutschuna
has
declared
that
you
shall
die
quickly
if
you
will
fulfil
the
condition
he
has
made
i
waited
for
him
to
ask
me
what
the
condition
was
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
poured
out
a
storm
of
abuse
upon
me
which
could
not
be
repeated
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
i
said
the
condition
is
that
you
ask
my
pardon
your
pardon
id
bite
my
tongue
out
first
and
suffer
all
the
tortures
this
red
beast
can
give
me
remember
i
did
not
make
the
condition
rattler
it
was
intschutschuna
who
decided
thus
for
i
dont
care
about
your
apology
consider
what
awful
agony
lies
before
you
and
that
you
can
escape
it
all
by
saying
the
little
word
pardon
never
never
get
out
i
tell
you
i
never
want
to
see
your
vile
face
again
go
and
dont
bother
me
if
i
go
now
it
will
be
too
late
to
call
me
back
be
sensible
and
speak
the
one
little
word
i
beg
you
no
i
tell
you
no
get
out
oh
if
i
werent
tied
id
show
you
the
way
as
you
please
but
if
you
call
me
back
i
cant
come
have
you
any
relatives
i
can
send
a
message
to
any
wish
that
i
can
carry
out
only
that
you
may
follow
me
soon
nothing
else
then
i
am
helpless
and
can
do
no
more
except
beg
you
as
a
christian
not
to
die
in
your
sins
ask
gods
pardon
if
not
mine
think
of
your
crimes
and
of
the
judgment
that
lies
before
you
what
his
reply
to
this
was
i
cannot
repeat
his
words
chilled
me
with
horror
intschutschuna
took
my
hand
and
led
me
away
saying
my
young
white
brother
sees
that
this
murderer
does
not
deserve
his
intercession
he
was
born
a
christian
and
you
call
us
heathen
but
do
you
think
a
red
brave
would
speak
such
words
i
did
not
answer
for
what
could
i
say
rattlers
conduct
was
inexplicable
to
me
he
had
been
so
cowardly
and
had
shown
such
abject
terror
at
the
very
mention
of
torture
and
now
he
acted
as
though
all
the
pains
of
the
world
were
absolutely
nothing
it
is
not
courage
said
sam
its
clear
rage
nothing
but
rage
he
thinks
its
your
fault
that
he
has
fallen
into
the
apaches
hands
he
hasnt
seen
you
since
we
were
captured
till
today
and
now
he
sees
you
free
and
the
red
men
friendly
to
you
while
he
must
die
and
thats
ground
enough
for
him
to
conclude
weve
played
some
trick
but
let
the
agony
begin
and
hell
sing
another
tune
the
apaches
did
not
let
us
wait
long
for
the
beginning
of
the
torture
i
meant
to
withdraw
but
i
had
never
seen
anything
of
the
kind
and
decided
to
stay
till
i
could
look
on
no
longer
several
young
braves
came
out
from
the
rest
with
knives
in
their
hands
and
placed
themselves
about
fifteen
feet
from
rattler
then
at
a
signal
from
the
chief
they
began
throwing
their
knives
at
him
in
such
a
way
that
these
would
not
touch
him
but
would
enter
the
coffin
all
around
him
the
first
knife
stuck
in
the
leather
at
the
right
the
second
in
that
at
the
left
of
his
feet
and
so
near
them
that
there
was
no
space
between
them
and
the
knives
the
next
two
knives
were
aimed
farther
up
and
so
on
until
the
legs
were
outlined
by
knives
till
now
rattler
had
kept
still
but
as
the
knives
came
higher
and
higher
till
his
whole
body
was
surrounded
by
them
he
began
to
be
afraid
as
each
knife
whizzed
through
the
air
he
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
and
these
cries
grew
shriller
and
shriller
the
higher
the
indians
aimed
now
the
body
was
all
framed
around
with
knives
only
the
head
being
free
the
first
of
the
knives
next
thrown
struck
the
coffin
to
the
left
of
the
neck
the
second
to
the
right
and
they
continued
around
the
face
till
there
was
no
room
left
for
the
smallest
blade
when
all
the
knives
were
drawn
out
this
was
only
a
little
introductory
game
played
by
young
lads
to
show
they
had
learned
to
aim
true
and
throw
straight
and
having
shown
their
skill
they
returned
to
their
places
intschutschuna
now
called
upon
older
youths
who
were
to
throw
at
a
distance
of
thirty
feet
when
the
first
of
this
band
was
ready
the
chief
went
up
to
rattler
and
pointing
to
the
upper
part
of
the
right
arm
said
aim
here
the
knife
flew
through
the
air
pierced
the
muscle
and
stuck
in
the
coffin
exactly
at
the
spot
designated
rattler
uttered
a
howl
as
if
he
were
in
his
last
agony
the
second
knife
went
through
the
same
spot
in
the
other
arm
and
his
howls
redoubled
the
third
and
fourth
knives
were
aimed
at
the
thigh
and
entered
exactly
at
the
spot
the
chief
indicated
if
rattler
had
fancied
that
the
indians
did
not
really
mean
to
kill
him
he
saw
now
that
he
was
mistaken
heretofore
he
had
uttered
only
single
cries
now
he
howled
unceasingly
the
spectators
murmured
and
hissed
showing
their
contempt
in
every
possible
way
an
indian
who
dies
by
torture
acts
far
differently
as
soon
as
the
spectacle
which
is
to
end
with
his
death
begins
he
raises
his
deathsong
in
which
he
celebrates
his
own
prowess
and
scorns
those
who
are
killing
him
the
greater
his
agony
the
greater
the
insults
he
heaps
upon
his
foes
and
he
never
lets
a
sigh
of
pain
be
heard
when
he
is
dead
his
enemies
acknowledge
his
glory
and
bury
him
with
all
indian
honors
it
is
glorious
for
them
to
put
such
a
hero
to
death
but
it
is
quite
different
in
the
case
of
a
coward
who
shrinks
from
the
slightest
pain
and
begs
for
mercy
there
is
no
glory
but
almost
disgrace
in
torturing
such
as
he
and
scarcely
a
warrior
is
willing
to
have
any
part
in
his
end
so
he
is
knocked
in
the
head
or
put
to
death
in
some
other
ignominious
way
such
a
coward
was
rattler
his
wounds
were
trifling
so
far
they
cost
him
some
pain
but
they
were
far
from
being
agony
nevertheless
he
howled
as
though
he
tasted
all
the
pains
of
the
lost
and
kept
repeating
my
name
begging
me
to
come
to
him
my
young
white
brother
may
go
to
him
and
ask
him
why
he
shrieks
so
the
knives
cannot
yet
have
given
him
much
pain
intschutschuna
said
at
last
yes
come
come
here
come
cried
rattler
i
must
speak
to
you
i
went
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
take
the
knives
out
of
my
arms
and
legs
he
whined
i
cant
do
that
but
theyll
kill
me
who
can
bear
such
wounds
good
gracious
is
it
possible
you
thought
youd
be
allowed
to
live
youre
alive
yes
but
i
have
not
committed
murder
i
did
not
know
what
i
did
you
know
i
was
drunk
the
fact
remains
the
same
you
were
often
warned
against
liquor
and
you
knew
when
you
took
it
what
a
beast
it
made
you
you
are
a
hard
cruel
man
plead
for
me
i
have
done
so
ask
pardon
and
you
shall
die
quickly
die
quickly
i
wont
die
i
must
live
live
live
that
is
impossible
impossible
is
there
no
hope
none
at
all
no
hope
no
hope
no
hope
he
wailed
and
began
such
a
clamor
of
cries
and
groans
that
i
could
not
stand
it
and
left
him
alone
stay
with
mestay
with
me
he
shrieked
stand
by
me
the
chief
interrupted
him
stop
howling
you
cur
you
are
not
worth
soiling
the
weapons
of
our
braves
and
turning
to
his
warriors
he
asked
which
of
the
sons
of
the
brave
apaches
will
put
an
end
to
this
coward
no
one
answered
will
no
one
do
it
again
silence
uff
this
murderer
is
not
worthy
to
be
killed
by
us
and
he
shall
not
be
buried
with
klekipetrah
how
could
such
a
crow
appear
in
the
happy
hunting
grounds
beside
a
swan
cut
him
loose
two
little
boys
sprang
forward
at
a
signal
drew
the
knives
from
rattlers
limbs
and
cut
his
bonds
bind
his
hands
behind
his
back
continued
the
chief
the
boys
who
could
not
have
been
more
than
ten
years
old
obeyed
him
and
rattler
did
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
at
resistance
what
a
disgrace
i
blushed
to
be
a
white
man
take
him
to
the
river
and
push
him
into
the
water
was
the
next
order
if
he
can
get
to
the
other
shore
he
shall
be
free
rattler
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
let
the
boys
lead
him
to
the
river
they
actually
did
push
him
in
for
he
had
not
sufficient
sense
of
decency
to
jump
in
himself
he
sank
at
once
but
came
up
again
quickly
and
tried
to
advance
by
swimming
on
his
back
which
was
not
difficult
though
his
hands
were
tied
for
his
legs
were
free
would
he
reach
the
opposite
bank
i
could
not
hope
that
he
would
he
deserved
to
die
and
if
he
were
allowed
to
live
the
one
who
spared
him
would
almost
render
himself
guilty
of
the
future
crimes
the
miserable
man
was
sure
to
commit
the
boys
stood
close
to
the
water
and
watched
him
get
guns
and
shoot
him
in
the
head
said
intschutschuna
the
children
ran
to
the
place
where
the
braves
had
left
their
weapons
and
each
took
a
gun
these
little
fellows
knew
well
how
to
handle
such
weapons
they
knelt
on
the
ground
and
aimed
at
rattlers
head
dont
shoot
for
heavens
sake
dont
shoot
he
cried
the
boys
spoke
to
one
another
they
acted
like
little
sportsmen
in
letting
rattler
swim
farther
and
farther
and
the
chief
did
not
interfere
seeing
they
knew
their
business
suddenly
their
shrill
boyish
voices
rang
out
in
a
sharp
cry
and
they
shot
rattler
was
hit
in
the
head
and
instantly
disappeared
under
the
water
no
cry
of
triumph
arose
such
as
indians
always
utter
at
the
death
of
an
enemy
such
a
coward
was
not
worth
breath
and
their
contempt
was
so
great
that
not
an
indian
looked
after
his
body
they
let
it
float
where
it
would
not
even
taking
the
trouble
to
make
sure
he
was
dead
intschutschuna
came
to
me
and
asked
is
my
young
white
brother
satisfied
with
me
yes
i
thank
you
you
have
no
reason
to
thank
me
if
i
had
not
known
your
wish
i
should
still
have
acted
nearly
as
i
did
this
cur
was
not
worthy
to
suffer
torture
you
have
seen
today
the
difference
between
brave
red
warriors
and
cowardly
white
men
the
palefaces
are
all
ready
for
any
wickedness
but
when
there
is
question
of
showing
courage
they
howl
like
dogs
that
see
the
whip
the
chief
of
the
apaches
must
remember
that
there
are
cowards
and
brave
men
everywhere
as
there
are
good
and
bad
ones
you
are
right
and
i
will
not
wound
you
but
no
nation
should
think
itself
better
than
another
because
it
is
not
of
the
same
color
chapter
xviii
teaching
winnetou
and
now
there
is
but
one
thing
left
to
do
to
finish
the
work
begun
in
our
meetinga
happy
meeting
in
some
ways
though
so
tragic
in
others
i
said
to
the
chief
as
we
walked
slowly
towards
winnetou
whom
we
saw
approaching
the
apache
braves
have
only
to
bury
klekipetrah
and
then
all
will
be
completed
will
it
not
yes
may
i
be
present
with
my
comrades
certainly
i
should
have
asked
you
had
you
not
made
the
request
you
talked
with
klekipetrah
on
that
miserable
morning
while
we
were
gone
for
our
horses
was
it
an
ordinary
conversation
no
it
was
a
very
earnest
one
and
important
to
us
both
may
i
tell
you
of
what
we
talked
winnetou
had
reached
us
as
i
spoke
and
i
turned
to
him
with
this
question
tell
us
he
said
while
you
were
gone
that
morning
klekipetrah
and
i
sat
down
beneath
a
tree
we
soon
discovered
that
we
were
of
the
same
faith
and
he
opened
his
heart
to
me
he
had
gone
through
a
great
deal
and
borne
much
and
he
told
me
of
his
life
he
also
told
me
how
dear
you
were
to
him
and
that
it
was
his
desire
to
die
for
winnetou
this
wish
the
great
spirit
fulfilled
but
a
few
moments
later
why
did
he
wish
to
die
for
me
asked
winnetou
because
he
loved
you
and
also
for
another
reason
which
i
will
explain
later
his
death
would
then
be
an
expiation
as
he
lay
dying
on
my
heart
he
spoke
to
you
in
a
tongue
i
could
not
understand
what
was
it
his
mother
tonguegerman
did
he
speak
of
me
then
too
yes
what
did
he
say
he
begged
me
to
be
true
to
you
be
trueto
me
you
did
not
know
me
then
i
knew
you
for
i
had
seen
you
and
whoever
sees
winnetou
must
know
what
kind
of
a
man
stands
before
him
besides
klekipetrah
told
me
of
you
what
answer
did
you
give
him
i
promised
to
fulfil
his
wish
it
was
his
last
wish
you
then
became
his
heir
you
promised
him
to
be
true
to
me
and
you
protected
me
guarded
me
watched
over
me
while
i
pursued
you
as
my
enemy
the
knifethrust
i
gave
you
would
have
been
fatal
to
another
but
your
stronger
frame
it
only
wounded
i
am
very
very
guilty
towards
you
be
my
friend
i
have
long
been
that
my
brother
with
all
my
heart
then
we
will
cement
the
bond
over
the
grave
of
him
who
gave
my
soul
into
your
care
a
noble
paleface
has
gone
from
us
and
even
in
going
has
given
us
another
equally
noble
my
blood
shall
be
your
blood
and
your
blood
shall
be
my
blood
i
will
drink
yours
and
you
shall
drink
mine
intschutschuna
the
greatest
chief
of
the
apaches
my
father
will
consent
to
this
intschutschuna
gave
us
each
a
hand
and
said
in
a
tone
that
evidently
came
from
his
heart
i
consent
you
shall
be
not
merely
brothers
but
a
single
man
with
two
bodies
how
having
said
this
the
chief
left
us
and
winnetou
and
i
went
away
together
and
sat
down
by
the
bank
of
the
broad
rio
pecos
now
reddening
in
the
setting
sun
the
depths
of
winnetous
earnest
nature
had
been
profoundly
stirred
by
what
he
had
just
learned
of
his
beloved
teachers
dying
love
and
care
for
him
he
took
my
hand
and
held
it
in
his
own
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
and
i
had
no
desire
to
break
the
silence
at
last
winnetou
moved
sighed
and
asked
will
my
brother
old
shatterhand
forget
that
we
were
his
enemies
it
is
already
forgotten
i
replied
but
there
is
one
thing
you
cannot
forgive
he
said
what
is
that
the
insult
my
father
gave
you
the
day
we
met
oh
after
the
murder
when
he
spat
in
my
face
yes
why
could
i
not
forgive
that
because
only
blood
can
wash
away
such
an
insult
winnetou
may
dismiss
all
thought
of
it
that
too
was
instantly
forgiven
my
brother
says
something
that
is
impossible
to
believe
you
must
believe
it
i
proved
long
ago
that
it
was
forgiven
for
if
it
were
not
i
should
have
revenged
myself
on
your
father
do
you
suppose
that
old
shatterhand
could
be
treated
thus
and
not
reply
with
his
fist
if
he
resented
it
we
wondered
afterward
that
you
did
not
do
this
the
father
of
winnetou
cannot
insult
me
it
was
all
a
mistake
that
is
all
let
us
talk
of
something
else
i
must
speak
of
this
for
i
should
be
guilty
if
i
did
not
tell
my
brother
the
custom
of
our
people
no
brave
ever
admits
a
mistake
and
a
chief
can
do
so
least
of
all
intschutschuna
knows
that
he
did
wrong
but
he
cannot
ask
your
forgiveness
therefore
he
bade
me
speak
of
it
to
you
winnetou
acts
for
his
father
that
was
not
at
all
necessary
and
in
any
case
we
are
quits
for
i
insulted
you
never
yes
isnt
a
blow
of
the
fist
an
insult
that
was
in
combat
where
it
cannot
count
as
an
insult
my
brother
is
noble
and
generous
we
will
not
forget
it
in
him
let
us
speak
of
other
things
dear
winnetou
i
am
to
become
an
apache
how
will
it
be
with
my
comrades
they
cannot
be
taken
into
the
tribe
but
they
are
our
brothers
without
any
ceremony
tomorrow
we
will
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
with
them
in
my
white
brothers
home
in
the
rising
sun
is
there
no
calumet
no
christians
are
all
brothers
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
announce
it
all
brothers
is
there
no
strife
between
them
certainly
there
is
then
they
are
not
different
from
us
or
better
than
we
they
teach
love
but
do
not
feel
it
why
did
my
brother
come
here
the
indians
never
ask
such
personal
questions
but
winnetou
could
do
so
in
my
case
because
we
were
to
be
brothers
and
he
must
learn
to
know
me
i
wanted
to
see
the
west
and
i
wanted
to
try
my
skill
in
my
profession
and
above
all
i
wanted
to
win
honor
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
win
honor
by
he
paused
by
stealing
your
lands
i
finished
for
him
truly
winnetou
i
never
thought
of
that
side
at
all
i
was
not
to
profit
by
the
road
except
as
i
did
my
work
well
and
was
paid
for
it
paid
paid
do
you
care
for
gold
do
you
need
it
i
have
an
uncle
a
second
father
who
will
give
me
all
i
require
but
every
young
man
of
spirit
wants
to
make
his
own
name
and
fortune
and
measuring
for
that
road
would
have
done
this
it
would
have
been
a
first
step
and
a
long
one
towards
it
and
now
you
will
not
get
your
reward
because
the
measuring
is
not
done
no
how
much
longer
time
would
have
been
necessary
to
finish
it
only
one
day
had
i
known
you
as
i
know
you
now
we
would
have
delayed
a
day
in
coming
back
that
i
might
have
finished
my
work
i
asked
touched
by
such
generosity
yes
that
means
that
you
would
have
consented
to
the
robbery
not
to
the
robbery
but
only
to
the
measuring
the
lines
you
make
on
paper
do
us
no
harm
the
robbery
only
begins
when
the
laborers
of
the
palefaces
come
to
build
the
road
for
their
firehorse
he
considered
a
while
and
a
thought
was
shaping
in
his
brain
of
such
nobility
that
i
doubt
if
many
white
men
would
have
been
capable
of
entertaining
it
at
last
he
uttered
it
my
white
brother
shall
receive
all
the
instruments
again
and
i
will
ask
my
father
to
allow
him
to
finish
measuring
for
the
road
we
will
go
with
our
warriors
and
protect
him
while
he
does
this
and
he
shall
send
his
papers
to
the
men
who
wanted
them
as
well
as
their
instruments
and
so
shall
he
make
this
first
step
towards
the
name
and
fortune
he
desires
winnetou
i
cried
moved
beyond
expression
by
a
generosity
which
i
could
hardly
fathom
dear
noble
kind
winnetou
there
is
no
one
like
you
i
can
never
thank
you
there
can
never
be
thanks
due
me
from
you
my
debt
must
always
be
greater
than
yours
and
my
father
has
said
we
shall
be
as
one
man
with
two
bodies
but
how
are
you
to
use
this
name
and
fortune
not
here
among
the
apaches
will
you
then
go
away
from
us
yes
but
not
immediately
we
shall
be
sorrowful
you
are
to
be
given
the
power
and
rank
of
a
chief
of
the
apaches
we
believed
you
would
stay
with
us
always
even
as
klekipetrah
stayed
to
the
day
of
his
death
my
circumstances
are
very
different
from
his
you
are
to
become
winnetous
brother
according
to
klekipetrahs
will
yet
you
would
forsake
him
is
that
right
yes
for
brothers
cannot
be
constantly
together
when
they
have
different
duties
to
fulfil
i
must
go
back
to
those
who
love
me
at
home
and
to
whom
i
owe
so
much
and
see
them
as
well
as
my
other
brother
here
then
we
shall
see
you
again
of
course
you
will
for
my
heart
will
draw
me
back
to
you
that
rejoices
my
soul
whenever
you
come
we
shall
be
glad
you
speak
of
other
duties
and
other
friends
could
you
not
be
happy
with
us
honestly
i
dont
know
i
love
winnetou
and
admire
his
noble
father
but
i
have
been
here
too
short
a
time
to
answer
that
question
it
is
as
when
two
birds
alight
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
one
is
nourished
by
the
fruit
of
that
tree
the
other
requires
different
food
and
must
fly
away
yet
you
must
believe
that
we
would
give
you
everything
you
desire
indeed
i
know
it
but
when
i
spoke
of
food
i
did
not
mean
the
nourishment
of
the
body
yes
i
understand
you
palefaces
speak
of
a
food
of
the
soul
i
have
heard
of
it
from
klekipetrah
he
missed
this
food
among
us
and
sometimes
he
was
very
sad
though
he
tried
not
to
let
us
see
it
but
every
spring
he
journeyed
to
santa
f
and
was
refreshed
in
soul
so
if
my
dear
brother
jack
must
go
he
shall
go
but
his
red
brother
begs
him
to
come
back
again
this
was
the
first
time
winnetou
had
ever
called
me
by
my
own
name
and
i
was
more
than
surprised
to
discover
in
him
a
knowledge
of
the
most
sacred
of
catholic
practices
for
of
course
he
spoke
of
klekipetrahs
going
to
santa
f
to
fulfil
his
easter
duties
winnetou
i
answered
sincerely
whatever
there
is
at
home
that
i
loveand
there
is
muchand
whatever
there
is
in
the
great
cities
of
the
east
to
satisfy
mind
and
soul
believe
me
i
have
learned
to
love
you
and
respect
you
too
deeply
to
leave
you
willingly
and
if
i
go
away
nothing
but
death
shall
keep
me
from
returning
to
my
red
brothers
side
and
some
day
my
brave
winnetous
noble
soul
also
shall
be
nourished
with
that
heavenly
food
which
klekipetrah
went
so
far
to
seek
and
which
i
need
to
help
me
on
the
way
he
has
gone
you
are
then
a
christian
really
believing
in
your
faith
he
asked
i
dont
say
im
a
good
christiangod
alone
knows
whether
or
not
i
am
thatbut
i
have
strong
faith
yes
and
id
gladly
be
a
good
one
and
you
think
we
are
heathen
no
you
believe
in
the
great
good
spirit
and
never
worship
idols
then
grant
me
one
request
gladly
what
is
it
never
speak
of
your
faith
to
me
never
try
to
convert
me
it
is
as
klekipetrah
said
your
faith
may
be
the
true
one
but
we
red
men
cannot
understand
it
if
christians
did
not
drive
us
out
and
oppress
us
we
might
feel
that
they
were
good
men
and
hold
their
teaching
as
good
then
we
might
have
time
and
place
to
learn
what
one
needs
to
know
of
your
holy
book
and
your
priests
teaching
in
order
to
understand
them
but
he
who
is
slowly
and
surely
driven
to
death
cannot
feel
that
the
religion
of
those
who
kill
him
is
the
religion
of
love
you
must
distinguish
between
the
religion
and
the
followers
who
only
acknowledge
it
in
words
but
never
act
by
its
light
i
said
at
a
loss
how
to
meet
this
reproach
so
all
the
palefaces
say
men
call
themselves
christians
yet
do
not
act
as
such
i
cannot
understand
how
it
is
that
only
one
man
and
now
that
you
have
come
i
will
say
two
men
of
all
the
palefaces
i
have
known
lived
up
to
the
christian
belief
we
have
our
good
manitou
who
wishes
all
men
to
be
good
i
try
to
do
as
he
wishes
perhaps
i
am
a
christiana
better
one
than
those
who
are
so
particular
about
the
name
but
have
no
love
in
them
and
never
follow
christian
teachings
so
never
speak
to
me
of
your
faith
and
never
try
to
make
me
a
man
who
is
called
a
christian
yet
may
be
none
that
is
the
request
you
must
fulfil
i
gave
the
promise
and
have
kept
it
are
words
necessary
is
not
practice
a
more
eloquent
preacher
than
mere
speech
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
said
our
lord
and
i
vowed
in
my
heart
to
be
winnetous
teacher
by
my
life
there
came
an
evening
at
last
never
to
be
forgotten
when
he
spoke
on
this
subject
himself
and
in
bitter
pain
i
reaped
the
fruit
of
loving
prayer
and
patient
sowing
as
the
dearest
friend
i
ever
had
lay
dead
with
the
waters
of
baptism
glistening
on
his
brow
now
i
contented
myself
with
a
pressure
of
his
hand
signifying
that
i
understood
all
the
bitterness
the
wrongs
of
his
race
caused
him
and
we
said
no
more
presently
we
arose
for
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
splendor
and
the
river
was
growing
purple
as
the
light
faded
we
went
back
to
the
pueblo
and
the
brave
chief
who
was
looking
for
us
welcomed
us
with
a
fatherly
kindness
i
had
not
felt
in
him
before
we
sat
down
to
our
smoking
meal
together
and
the
beautiful
fair
day
served
us
so
gracefully
so
affectionately
that
i
thought
with
wonder
how
truly
among
all
sorts
of
men
home
was
home
and
love
made
homecoming
sweet
chapter
xix
the
burial
of
klekipetrah
the
morning
dawned
fair
and
warm
and
the
pueblo
was
early
astir
for
the
burial
of
klekipetrah
not
all
of
the
apaches
lived
in
the
pueblo
for
though
it
was
large
it
would
have
been
far
too
small
to
have
accommodated
them
only
intschutschuna
and
his
most
important
braves
dwelt
here
forming
with
their
families
and
herds
of
horses
the
central
point
of
the
tribe
of
mascalerosapaches
from
this
pueblo
the
chief
ruled
over
the
tribe
and
thence
took
long
journeys
to
the
various
branches
of
the
great
apache
family
which
acknowledged
him
as
their
head
representatives
of
every
tribe
had
assembled
to
pay
their
last
tribute
to
the
white
friend
whom
they
had
all
loved
and
honored
and
who
had
been
faithful
to
them
even
unto
death
we
my
comrades
and
i
repaired
early
to
the
spot
where
the
grave
was
to
be
erected
i
estimated
the
height
and
breadth
of
the
mass
of
stone
and
then
taking
a
tomahawk
hawkins
stone
parker
and
i
went
through
the
woods
following
the
river
downward
seeking
a
suitable
tree
from
which
to
make
a
cross
when
we
returned
to
the
burialplace
the
sorrowful
ceremonies
had
begun
the
indians
had
worked
rapidly
on
the
construction
of
the
tomb
which
was
nearly
finished
it
was
surrounded
by
braves
who
were
intoning
their
peculiar
and
profoundly
touching
deathsong
its
dull
monotonous
tone
was
broken
occasionally
by
a
shrill
piercing
cry
which
startled
the
ear
as
a
sudden
flash
of
lightning
from
heavy
clouds
startles
the
eye
by
flashing
across
it
twelve
indians
were
working
on
the
tomb
under
the
direction
of
the
two
chiefs
and
between
them
and
the
singers
danced
a
figure
decked
in
all
the
insignia
of
his
race
and
making
grotesque
slow
motions
and
curious
leaps
who
is
thatthe
medicineman
i
asked
yes
sam
replied
indian
customs
at
the
burial
of
a
catholic
what
do
you
say
to
that
my
dear
sam
you
dont
like
it
asked
sam
certainly
not
then
dont
show
it
you
would
offend
the
apaches
mortally
but
this
absurd
mumming
annoys
me
more
than
i
can
say
they
mean
well
they
cant
do
better
than
they
know
it
isnt
heathenish
these
good
folks
believe
in
one
great
spirit
to
whom
their
dead
friend
and
teacher
has
gone
they
bid
him
farewell
and
mourn
his
death
in
their
own
way
and
everything
that
medicineman
does
has
a
symbolic
meaning
let
them
do
as
they
will
there
is
no
priest
anywhere
near
here
and
they
wont
prevent
us
putting
our
cross
at
the
head
of
the
grave
as
we
placed
the
cross
before
the
coffin
winnetou
asked
shall
this
sign
of
christianity
be
placed
over
the
grave
yes
that
is
right
i
should
have
asked
my
brother
old
shatterhand
to
make
a
cross
for
klekipetrah
had
one
in
his
dwelling
and
begged
us
to
put
one
over
his
grave
when
he
should
die
where
must
it
stand
at
the
head
of
the
grave
as
in
those
great
tall
houses
in
which
christians
pray
to
the
great
spirit
i
have
seen
them
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
sit
here
and
see
that
it
is
done
properly
in
a
short
time
the
tomb
was
complete
it
was
crowned
by
our
cross
and
had
an
opening
left
to
receive
the
coffin
which
still
stood
outside
then
came
nschotschi
she
had
been
to
the
pueblo
to
get
two
clay
cups
which
she
had
taken
to
the
river
and
filled
with
water
having
done
this
she
returned
to
the
grave
and
set
them
on
the
coffinfor
what
purpose
i
was
soon
to
learn
everything
was
now
ready
for
the
burial
intschutschuna
gave
a
signal
with
his
hand
for
the
song
of
lamentation
to
cease
the
medicineman
squatted
upon
the
ground
the
chief
went
up
to
the
coffin
and
spoke
slowly
and
solemnly
my
brothers
and
sisters
of
all
the
tribes
of
the
apaches
he
began
the
sun
rises
in
the
morning
in
the
east
and
sinks
at
night
into
the
west
and
the
year
awakes
in
the
springtime
and
in
winter
sleeps
again
so
is
it
also
with
man
is
this
true
how
arose
heavily
on
all
sides
man
rises
like
the
sun
and
sinks
again
into
the
grave
he
comes
like
spring
upon
the
earth
and
like
winter
lays
himself
down
to
rest
but
though
the
sun
sets
it
shines
again
in
the
morning
and
when
winter
disappears
once
more
the
spring
is
here
is
this
true
how
thus
has
klekipetrah
taught
us
man
will
be
laid
in
the
grave
but
beyond
death
he
rises
again
like
a
new
day
and
a
new
spring
to
live
forever
in
the
land
of
the
great
good
spirit
this
has
klekipetrah
told
us
and
now
he
knows
whether
he
spoke
truly
or
not
for
he
has
disappeared
like
the
day
and
the
year
and
his
spirit
has
gone
to
the
dwelling
of
the
dead
for
which
he
always
longed
is
this
true
how
his
faith
was
not
ours
nor
is
our
faith
his
we
hate
our
enemies
and
love
our
friends
but
he
taught
us
that
man
must
also
love
his
enemies
for
they
too
are
our
brothers
that
we
do
not
believe
yet
when
we
have
obeyed
his
words
it
has
been
peaceful
and
well
for
us
perhaps
his
faith
is
also
ours
only
we
could
not
understand
him
as
he
wished
to
be
understood
we
say
our
spirits
go
to
the
eternal
happy
hunting
grounds
and
he
hoped
for
eternal
blessedness
often
i
think
our
hunting
grounds
may
be
his
blessedness
is
this
true
how
he
often
told
us
of
the
saviour
who
came
to
make
all
men
blessed
we
believe
in
his
words
because
there
was
never
a
lie
on
his
lips
this
saviour
came
for
all
men
has
he
been
with
the
red
man
if
he
came
we
would
welcome
him
for
we
shall
be
destroyed
or
driven
away
by
the
palefaces
and
we
long
for
him
is
this
true
how
this
was
klekipetrahs
teaching
now
i
speak
of
his
end
it
came
upon
him
as
a
wild
beast
falls
upon
its
prey
sudden
and
unforeseen
it
was
he
was
strong
and
well
and
stood
at
our
side
he
would
have
mounted
his
horse
and
ridden
home
with
us
but
the
bullet
of
the
murderer
struck
him
my
brothers
and
sisters
may
lament
him
there
arose
a
dull
cry
of
woe
growing
louder
and
higher
till
it
ended
in
a
piercing
shriek
then
the
chief
continued
we
have
avenged
his
death
the
cowardly
dog
who
killed
him
was
not
worthy
to
follow
him
in
death
he
has
been
shot
by
the
children
and
his
body
floats
down
the
stream
is
this
true
how
now
is
the
spirit
of
klekipetrah
gone
from
us
but
his
body
remains
over
which
we
raise
a
memorial
to
him
to
show
to
our
successors
that
we
had
a
good
white
father
who
was
our
teacher
and
whom
we
loved
he
was
not
born
in
this
land
but
he
came
from
afar
beyond
the
big
water
where
oaks
grow
so
to
honor
him
and
speak
of
our
love
for
him
we
have
brought
an
oak
to
plant
beside
his
grave
and
as
it
sprouts
and
spreads
so
will
his
spirit
grow
great
beyond
the
grave
and
as
the
oak
grows
so
will
the
words
which
we
have
heard
from
him
sprout
in
our
hearts
and
our
spirits
shall
find
shelter
under
its
shade
but
he
has
not
gone
from
us
without
sending
us
a
paleface
who
shall
be
our
friend
and
brother
in
his
place
here
you
see
old
shatterhand
a
white
man
who
knows
all
that
klekipetrah
knew
and
is
a
stronger
warrior
than
he
he
has
killed
the
grizzly
bear
with
his
knife
and
all
his
foes
he
strikes
to
earth
with
his
fist
intschutschuna
and
winnetou
were
repeatedly
in
his
power
yet
he
did
not
slay
us
but
gave
us
our
lives
because
he
loved
us
and
is
a
friend
of
the
red
man
is
this
true
how
it
was
klekipetrahs
last
word
and
last
wish
that
old
shatterhand
should
be
his
successor
with
the
apache
warriors
and
old
shatterhand
has
promised
to
fulfil
this
wish
therefore
he
shall
be
received
into
the
apache
tribe
and
become
a
chief
it
shall
be
as
though
he
were
red
of
skin
and
born
among
us
to
accomplish
this
he
must
have
smoked
the
calumet
with
every
grown
warrior
of
the
apaches
but
this
shall
not
be
necessary
for
he
will
drink
winnetous
blood
and
winnetou
will
drink
his
and
then
he
will
be
blood
of
our
blood
and
flesh
of
our
flesh
do
the
apache
braves
agree
to
this
how
how
how
arose
thrice
repeated
the
unanimous
response
of
all
present
then
let
winnetou
and
old
shatterhand
come
here
to
the
coffin
and
let
their
blood
drop
into
the
water
of
the
bond
of
brotherhood
i
had
often
read
of
the
blood
bond
of
brotherhood
it
is
a
custom
among
many
savage
and
halfcivilized
people
and
usually
consists
of
the
mingling
of
the
blood
of
the
two
making
the
compact
which
is
drunk
by
both
and
in
consequence
they
become
more
closely
united
more
truly
brothers
than
if
they
had
been
born
of
the
same
parents
winnetou
and
i
were
to
drink
each
others
blood
we
placed
ourselves
on
each
side
of
the
coffin
and
intschutschuna
pricked
first
his
sons
wrist
holding
it
over
the
cup
which
nschotschi
had
brought
a
tiny
drop
of
blood
fell
into
it
and
the
chief
set
it
aside
then
he
repeated
the
proceeding
with
me
and
a
tiny
drop
of
my
blood
fell
into
the
other
cup
winnetou
took
the
cup
containing
my
blood
in
his
hand
and
i
received
the
one
with
his
then
intschutschuna
said
life
dwells
in
the
blood
the
souls
of
these
two
young
men
shall
mingle
till
there
is
but
one
soul
in
them
old
shatterhands
thoughts
shall
be
winnetous
thoughts
and
what
winnetou
wills
that
shall
also
be
the
will
of
old
shatterhand
drink
i
raised
my
cup
as
winnetou
raised
his
it
was
rio
pecos
water
to
which
the
single
drop
of
blood
in
it
imparted
no
taste
as
we
set
down
the
empty
cups
the
chief
took
my
hand
and
said
thou
art
now
the
son
of
my
flesh
equally
with
winnetou
and
a
warrior
of
our
people
the
renown
of
thy
deeds
shall
be
quickly
known
everywhere
and
no
other
warrior
shall
surpass
thee
thou
art
a
chief
of
the
apaches
and
all
branches
of
our
people
shall
honor
thee
as
such
this
was
indeed
rapid
advancementfrom
a
young
newly
graduated
collegiate
to
a
chief
of
the
apaches
and
i
could
not
help
fancying
the
faces
of
my
friends
at
home
if
they
could
see
me
now
and
yet
strange
and
wild
as
was
the
life
around
me
these
fine
red
men
were
far
more
congenial
to
me
than
many
of
my
former
associates
how
completely
the
words
of
intschutschuna
were
fulfilled
that
winnetou
and
i
should
be
but
one
soul
in
two
bodies
we
grew
to
understand
each
other
without
a
word
we
had
but
to
look
at
each
other
to
know
what
we
desired
and
felt
and
there
was
never
the
slightest
disagreement
between
us
but
i
suspect
this
was
less
because
we
had
drunk
one
anothers
blood
than
because
there
was
naturally
a
strong
attraction
and
sympathy
between
us
and
never
again
shall
i
love
another
friend
as
i
loved
my
brave
apache
brother
my
truehearted
winnetou
as
intschutschuna
spoke
the
last
words
all
the
apaches
had
risen
even
the
children
to
shout
a
loud
applauding

then
the

added
now
is
the
new
the
living
klekipetrah
received
among
us
and
we
can
lay
the
dead
in
his
grave
my
brothers
may
now
do
this
this
was
spoken
to
the
indians
who
had
built
the
tomb
i
asked
for
a
few
minutes
delay
and
nodded
to
sam
hawkins
dick
stone
and
will
parker
to
come
up
with
these
standing
by
me
i
said
an
our
father
a
hail
mary
and
a
de
profundis
over
the
coffin
then
was
the
body
of
the
former
atheist
and
revolutionist
and
at
last
the
penitent
and
missionary
lowered
into
the
middle
of
the
tomb
which
the
indians
sealed
to
await
the
dawn
of
that
new
day
of
which
intschutschuna
had
spoken
this
was
my
first
experience
of
a
burial
ceremony
among
savages
and
it
deeply
impressed
me
i
was
touched
by
the
half
perception
of
truth
which
appeared
in
the
chiefs
words
especially
was
i
moved
by
the
longing
for
the
coming
of
one
who
was
to
deliver
them
which
rang
in
these
wordsa
longing
like
that
of
the
people
of
israel
as
they
waited
for
the
messiahs
while
the
grave
was
closing
the
indians
deathchant
was
sung
again
and
it
sank
into
silence
when
the
last
stone
was
placed
the
apaches
rose
from
their
places
and
the
whole
great
assembly
seemed
to
melt
away
in
the
stillness
broken
only
by
the
fall
of
their
moccasins
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
the
ripple
of
the
rio
pecos
nschotschi
came
from
among
the
women
and
stood
at
her
fathers
right
hand
winnetous
arm
lay
across
my
shoulders
as
he
stood
at
his
fathers
other
side
and
intschutschuna
had
taken
my
right
hand
in
his
own
you
are
my
children
and
i
am
happy
in
you
he
said
i
thank
the
great
spirit
that
he
has
protected
me
through
danger
and
given
me
a
strong
brave
faithful
son
and
my
other
children
a
brother
to
protect
them
when
i
am
gone
no
intschutschuna
i
said
rather
should
i
thank
him
for
the
love
and
kindness
i
find
so
far
from
home
and
among
a
strange
people
they
are
your
people
now
said
nschotschi
quickly
and
we
are
all
happy
and
blest
in
one
another
said
winnetou
all
grateful
for
the
happy
ending
of
a
story
begun
in
sorrow
and
wrath
come
my
brother
let
us
go
to
the
dwelling
of
our
father
intschutschuna
a
new
life
has
begun
for
us
all
today
and
so
we
walked
together
to
the
great
pueblo
silent
and
peaceful
though
saddened
by
the
solemn
ceremony
and
parting
from
one
the
three
indians
had
loved
so
well
winnetou
spoke
truly
though
the
story
of
our
meeting
ended
here
a
new
life
had
indeed
begun
and
unconscious
of
what
lay
before
us
we
went
home
together
turning
our
backs
on
what
had
been
and
setting
our
faces
towards
the
future
